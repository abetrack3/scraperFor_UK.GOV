"Boris Johnson","Boris Johnson's first speech as Prime Minister: 24 July 2019","24 July 2019","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/boris-johnsons-first-speech-as-prime-minister-24-july-2019","Good afternoon I have just been to see Her Majesty the Queen who has invited me to form a government and I have accepted I pay tribute to the fortitude and patience of my predecessor and her deep sense of public service but in spite of all her efforts it has become clear that there are pessimists at home and abroad who think that after three years of indecision that this country has become a prisoner to the old arguments of 2016 and that in this home of democracy we are incapable of honouring a basic democratic mandate And so I am standing before you today to tell you the British people that those critics are wrong The doubters, the doomsters, the gloomsters – they are going to get it wrong again The people who bet against Britain are going to lose their shirts because we are going to restore trust in our democracy and we are going to fulfil the repeated promises of parliament to the people and come out of the EU on October 31 no ifs or buts and we will do a new deal, a better deal that will maximise the opportunities of Brexit while allowing us to develop a new and exciting partnership with the rest of Europe based on free trade and mutual support I have every confidence that in 99 days’ time we will have cracked it but you know what – we aren’t going to wait 99 days because the British people have had enough of waiting The time has come to act, to take decisions to give strong leadership and to change this country for the better and though the Queen has just honoured me with this extraordinary office of state my job is to serve you, the people because if there is one point we politicians need to remember it is that the people are our bosses My job is to make your streets safer – and we are going to begin with another 20,000 police on the streets and we start recruiting forthwith My job is to make sure you don’t have to wait 3 weeks to see your GP and we start work this week with 20 new hospital upgrades, and ensuring that money for the NHS really does get to the front line My job is to protect you or your parents or grandparents from the fear of having to sell your home to pay for the costs of care and so I am announcing now – on the steps of Downing Street – that we will fix the crisis in social care once and for all with a clear plan we have prepared to give every older person the dignity and security they deserve My job is to make sure your kids get a superb education wherever they are in the country and that’s why we have already announced that we are going to level up per pupil funding in primary and secondary schools and that is the work that begins immediately behind that black door and though I am today building a great team of men and women I will take personal responsibility for the change I want to see Never mind the backstop – the buck stops here And I will tell you something else about my job. It is to be Prime Minister of the whole United Kingdom and that means uniting our country answering at last the plea of the forgotten people and the left behind towns by physically and literally renewing the ties that bind us together so that with safer streets and better education and fantastic new road and rail infrastructure and full fibre broadband we level up across Britain with higher wages, and a higher living wage, and higher productivity we close the opportunity gap giving millions of young people the chance to own their own homes and giving business the confidence to invest across the UK because it is time we unleashed the productive power not just of London and the South East but of every corner of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland the awesome foursome that are incarnated in that red white and blue flag who together are so much more than the sum of their parts and whose brand and political personality is admired and even loved around the world for our inventiveness, for our humour, for our universities, our scientists, our armed forces, our diplomacy for the equalities on which we insist – whether race or gender or LGBT or the right of every girl in the world to 12 years of quality education and for the values we stand for around the world Everyone knows the values that flag represents It stands for freedom and free speech and habeas corpus and the rule of law and above all it stands for democracy and that is why we will come out of the EU on October 31 because in the end Brexit was a fundamental decision by the British people that they wanted their laws made by people that they can elect and they can remove from office and we must now respect that decision and create a new partnership with our European friends – as warm and as close and as affectionate as possible and the first step is to repeat unequivocally our guarantee to the 3.2 m EU nationals now living and working among us and I say directly to you – thank you for your contribution to our society thank you for your patience and I can assure you that under this government you will get the absolute certainty of the rights to live and remain And next I say to our friends in Ireland, and in Brussels and around the EU I am convinced that we can do a deal without checks at the Irish border, because we refuse under any circumstances to have such checks and yet without that anti-democratic backstop and it is of course vital at the same time that we prepare for the remote possibility that Brussels refuses any further to negotiate and we are forced to come out with no deal not because we want that outcome – of course not but because it is only common sense to prepare and let me stress that there is a vital sense in which those preparations cannot be wasted and that is because under any circumstances we will need to get ready at some point in the near future to come out of the EU customs union and out of regulatory control fully determined at last to take advantage of brexit because that is the course on which this country is now set with high hearts and growing confidence we will now accelerate the work of getting ready and the ports will be ready and the banks will be ready and the factories will be ready and business will be ready and the hospitals will be ready and our amazing food and farming sector will be ready and waiting to continue selling ever more not just here but around the world and don’t forget that in the event of a no deal outcome we will have the extra lubrication of the £39 bn and whatever deal we do we will prepare this autumn for an economic package to boost British business and to lengthen this country’s lead as the number one destination in this continent for overseas investment and to all those who continue to prophesy disaster I say yes – there will be difficulties though I believe that with energy and application they will be far less serious than some have claimed but if there is one thing that has really sapped the confidence of business over the last three years it is not the decisions we have taken it is our refusal to take decisions and to all those who say we cannot be ready I say do not underestimate this country Do not underestimate our powers of organisation and our determination because we know the enormous strengths of this economy in life sciences, in tech, in academia, in music, the arts, culture, financial services, It is here in Britain that we are using gene therapy, for the first time, to treat the most common form of blindness here in Britain that we are leading the world in the battery technology that will help cut CO2 and tackle climate change and produce green jobs for the next generation and as we prepare for a post-Brexit future it is time we looked not at the risks but at the opportunities that are upon us so let us begin work now to create freeports that will drive growth and thousands of high-skilled jobs in left behind areas let’s start now to liberate the UK’s extraordinary bioscience sector from anti genetic modification rules and let’s develop the blight-resistant crops that will feed the world let’s get going now on our own position navigation and timing satellite and earth observation systems – UK assets orbiting in space with all the long term strategic and commercial benefits for this country Let’s change the tax rules to provide extra incentives to invest in capital and research and let’s promote the welfare of animals that has always been so close to the hearts of the British people and yes, let’s start now on those free trade deals because it is free trade that has done more than anything else to lift billions out of poverty all this and more we can do now and only now, at this extraordinary moment in our history and after three years of unfounded self-doubt it is time to change the record to recover our natural and historic role as an enterprising, outward-looking and truly global Britain, generous in temper and engaged with the world No one in the last few centuries has succeeded in betting against the pluck and nerve and ambition of this country They will not succeed today We in this government will work flat out to give this country the leadership it deserves and that work begins now Thank you very much"
"Boris Johnson","Theresa May's final speech as Prime Minister: 24 July 2019","24 July 2019","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/theresa-mays-final-speech-as-prime-minister-24-july-2019","I am about to go to Buckingham Palace to tender my resignation to Her Majesty the Queen and to advise her to ask Boris Johnson to form a new administration. I repeat my warm congratulations to Boris on winning the Conservative leadership election. I wish him and the Government he will lead every good fortune in the months and years ahead. Their successes will be our country’s successes, and I hope that they will be many. Their achievements will build on the work of nearly a decade of Conservative or Conservative-led government. During that time our economy has been restored, our public services reformed, and our values defended on the world stage. Of course, much remains to be done – the immediate priority being to complete our exit from the European Union in a way that works for the whole United Kingdom. With success in that task can come a new beginning for our country – a national renewal that can move us beyond the current impasse into the bright future the British people deserve. To serve as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom is the greatest honour. The heavy responsibilities are outweighed by the huge potential to serve your country. But you achieve nothing alone. And as I leave Downing Street, my final words are of sincere thanks. To my colleagues in Government and Parliament. To everyone in the building behind me and across the Civil Service. To the men and women of our armed forces and security services. And to the public servants in our schools, our NHS, our police and the other emergency services. All are inspired by the noble wish to serve their country in the national interest. I also want to thank the British people. Everyone who loves our great country, who works hard for their family and wants their children and grand-children to enjoy greater opportunity than they did. Thank you for putting your faith in me and giving me the chance to serve. This is a country of aspiration and opportunity and I hope that every young girl who has seen a woman Prime Minister now knows for sure that there are no limits to what they can achieve. Finally and most of all, I want to thank my husband Philip – who has been my greatest supporter and my closest companion. I am about to leave Downing Street but I am proud to continue as the Member of Parliament for Maidenhead. I will continue to do all I can to serve the national interest. And play my part in making our United Kingdom – a great country with a great future – a country that truly works for everyone."
"Boris Johnson","PM statement on priorities for the government: 25 July 2019","25 July 2019","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-statement-on-priorities-for-the-government-25-july-2019","Mr Speaker, I with permission, shall make a statement on the mission of this new Conservative Government. But before I begin, I am sure the whole House will join me in paying tribute to my Rt Hon Friend the Member for Maidenhead - for all that she has given in the service of our nation. From fighting modern slavery to tackling the problems of mental ill-health – she has a great legacy on which we shall all be proud to build. And our mission is to deliver Brexit on the 31st of October for the purpose of uniting and re-energising our great United Kingdom and making this country the greatest place on earth. And when I say the greatest place on earth, I’m conscious that some may accuse me of hyperbole. But it is useful to imagine the trajectory on which we could now be embarked. By 2050 it is more than possible that the United Kingdom will be the greatest and most prosperous economy in Europe – at the centre of a new network of trade deals that we have pioneered. With the road and rail investments we are making and propose to make now – the investment in broadband and 5G – our country will boast the most formidable transport and technological connectivity on the planet. By unleashing the productive power of the whole United Kingdom - not just of London and the South East but of every corner of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland – we will have closed forever the productivity gap and seen to it that no town is left behind ever again; no community ever again forgotten. Our children and grandchildren will be living longer, happier, healthier, wealthier lives. Our United Kingdom of 2050 will no longer make any contribution whatsoever to the destruction of our precious planet brought about by carbon emissions – because we will have led the world in delivering that net zero target. We will be the home of electric vehicles – cars, even planes, powered by British made battery technology being developed right here, right now. We will have the freeports to revitalise our coastal communities, a bioscience sector liberated from anti genetic modification rules, blight-resistant crops that will feed the world - and the satellite and earth observation systems that are the envy of the world. We will be the seedbed for the most exciting and most dynamic business investments on the planet. Our Constitutional settlement, our United Kingdom will be firm, will be secure. Our Union of nations beyond question. Our democracy robust. Our future clean, green, prosperous, united, confident, ambitious – this my friends is the prize, more still the responsibility that it falls on us to fulfil. And to do so, we must take some immediate steps. The first is to restore trust in our democracy and fulfil the repeated promises of Parliament to the people by coming out of the European Union – and doing so on October 31st. I and all ministers in this government are committed to leaving on this date, whatever the circumstances. To do otherwise would cause a catastrophic loss of confidence in our political system. It will leave the British people wondering whether their politicians could ever be trusted again to follow a clear democratic instruction. I would prefer us to leave the EU with a deal. I would much prefer it. I believe that is still possible even at this late stage and I will work flat out to make it happen. But certain things need to be clear. The Withdrawal Agreement negotiated by my predecessor has been three times rejected by this House. Its terms are unacceptable to this Parliament and to this country. No country that values its independence and indeed its self-respect could agree to a Treaty which signed away our economic independence and self-government as this backstop does. A time limit is not enough. If an agreement is to be reached it must be clearly understood that the way to the deal goes by way of the abolition of the backstop. For our part we are ready to negotiate in good faith an alternative, with provisions to ensure that the Irish border issues are dealt with where they should always have been: in the negotiations on the future agreement between the UK and the EU. I do not accept the argument that says that these issues can only be solved by all or part of the UK remaining in the customs union or in the single market. The evidence is that other arrangements are perfectly possible, and are also perfectly compatible with the Belfast or Good Friday Agreement, to which we are of course steadfastly committed. I, my team, and my Rt Hon Friend the Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union are ready to meet and to talk on this basis to the Commission or other EU colleagues whenever they are ready to do so. For our part, we will throw ourselves into these negotiations with the greatest energy and determination and in the spirit of friendship. And I hope that the EU will be equally ready and that they will rethink their current refusal to make any changes to the Withdrawal Agreement. If they do not, we will of course have to leave the EU without an agreement under Article 50. The UK is better prepared for that situation than many believe. But we are not as ready yet as we should be. In the 98 days that remain to us we must turbo-charge our preparations to make sure that there is as little disruption as possible to our national life. I believe that is possible with the kind of national effort that the British people have made before and will make again. In these circumstances we would, of course, also have available the £39bn in the Withdrawal Agreement to help deal with any consequences. I have today instructed the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster to make these preparations his top priority. I have asked the Cabinet Secretary to mobilise the Civil Service to deliver this outcome should it become necessary. And the Chancellor has confirmed that all necessary funding will be made available. I will also ensure that preparing for leaving the EU without an agreement under Article 50 is not just about seeking to mitigate the challenges but also about grasping the opportunities. This is not just about technical preparations, vital though they are. It is about having a clear economic strategy for the UK in all scenarios, something which the Conservative Party has always led the way, and it’s about producing policies which will boost the competitiveness and the productivity of our economy when we are free of the EU regulations. Indeed, Mr Speaker, we will begin right away on working to change the tax rules to provide extra incentives to invest in capital and research. And we will be now accelerating the talks on those free trade deals. And we will prepare an economic package to boost British business and lengthen this country’s lead as the number one destination in this continent for overseas investment. A status that is made possible by the diversity talent and skills of our workforce and, Mr Speaker, I also want therefore to repeat unequivocally our guarantee to the 3.2 million EU nationals now living and working among us. I thank them for their contribution to our society – and for their patience - and I can assure them that under this government they will have the absolute certainty of the right to live and remain. Mr Speaker, I want to end by making clear that my commitment to the 31 October date for our exit. Our national participation in the European Union is coming to an end. This reality needs to be recognised by all parties. Indeed, Mr Speaker today there are very many brilliant officials trapped in meeting after meeting in Brussels and Luxembourg when they could be better deploying their talents in preparing to pioneer new trade deals and promoting a truly Global Britain. I want to start unshackling our officials to undertake this new mission right away. So we will not nominate a UK Commissioner for the new Commission taking office on 1 November – though clearly this is not intended to stop the EU appointing a new commission. Mr Speaker, today is the first day of a new approach, which will end with our exit from the EU on 31 October. Then I hope we can have a friendly and constructive relationship – as constitutional equals, as friends, and partners in facing the challenges that lie ahead. I believe that is possible and this government will work to make it so. But Mr Speaker, we are not going to wait until 31st October to begin building the broader and bolder future that I have described. We are going to start right away, providing vital funding for our frontline public services, to deliver better healthcare, better education and more police on the streets. Mr Speaker, I am committed to making sure that the NHS receives the funds that were promised by the last government in June 2018 and that these funds go to frontline as soon as possible. This will include urgent funding for 20 hospital upgrades and winter-readiness. I have asked officials to provide policy proposals for drastically reducing waiting times and for GP appointments. To address the rise of violent crime in our country I have announced that there will be 20,000 extra police keeping us safe over the next three years, and I have asked my Rt Hon Friend the Home Secretary to ensure this is treated as an absolute priority. We will give greater powers for the police to use stop and search to help tackle violent crime. I have also tasked officials to draw up proposals to ensure that in future those found guilty of the most serious sexual and violent offences are required to serve a custodial sentence that truly reflects the severity of their offence and policy measures that will see a reduction in the number of prolific offenders. On education, I have listened to the concerns of many colleagues and we will increase the minimum level of per pupil funding in primary and secondary schools and return education funding to previous levels by the end of this Parliament. We are committed to levelling up across every nation and region across the UK, providing support to towns and cities and closing the opportunity gap in our society. We will announce investment in vital infrastructure, fibre rollout, transport and housing that can improve people’s quality of life, fuel economic growth and provide opportunity. Finally, we will also ensure that we continue to attract the brightest and best talent from around the world. No-one believes more strongly than me in the benefits of migration to our country. But I am clear that our immigration system must change. For years, politicians have promised the public an Australian-style points based system. And today I will actually deliver on those promises - I will ask the Migration Advisory Committee to conduct a review of that system as the first step in a radical rewriting of our immigration system. I am convinced that we can produce a system that the British public can have confidence in. Mr Speaker, over these past few years, too many people in this country feel that they have been told repeatedly and relentlessly what we cannot do. Since I was a child I remember respectable authorities asserting that our time as a nation has passed, that we should be content with mediocrity and managed decline. And time and again – even the sceptics and doubters - by their powers to innovate and adapt the British people have showed the doubters wrong. And Mr Speaker I believe that at this pivotal moment in our national story we are going to prove the doubters wrong again. Not just with positive thinking and a can-do attitude, important though they are. But with the help and the encouragement government and a Cabinet that is bursting with ideas, ready to create change, determined to implement the policies we need to succeed as a nation. The greatest place to live The greatest place to bring up a family The greatest place to send your kids to school The greatest place to set up a business or to invest Because we have the best transport and the cleanest environment and the best healthcare, And the most compassionate approach to care of elderly people. That is the mission of the Cabinet I have appointed. That is the purpose of the government I am leading. And that is why I believe that if we bend our sinews to the task now, There is every chance that in 2050, When I fully intend to be around, though not necessarily in this job we will look back on this period, this extraordinary period, as the beginning of a new golden age for our United Kingdom. And I commend this future to the House just as much as I commend this statement."
"Boris Johnson","PM statement at G7: 26 August 2019","26 August 2019","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-statement-at-g7-26-august-2019","I’d like to thank President Macron for an incredibly stylish and highly effective Summit that he’s just hosted for us here in Biarritz. Every conversation that I’ve had with my fellow leaders, I’ve been struck by their enthusiasm to expand and strengthen their relations with our country – whether that’s on trade or security or defence, science and indeed the growing opportunities we’ve had to collaborate in space and technology. We’ve also spoken in Biarritz about the biggest global challenges confronting us all today and these are things that I think very much matter to the people in the UK. We’ve been talking about biodiversity. We’ve got to stop the tragic loss of habitats and species that is happening around the world. We can’t just sit back as animals and plants are wiped off the face of the planet. The world’s animal populations have declined by about 60% in the last fifty years – about a million species are now facing extinction. And we’ve seen in the Amazon rainforest the tragic increase in fires which are made more likely by deforestation. And that’s why today I’ve announce £10 million in new funding to protect and restore the rainforest in Brazil. With one million birds and 100,000 mammals losing their lives every year from eating or getting tangled in ocean plastic – we’ve got to do much more to protect the oceans, and today I’ve announced £7 million for the Blue Belt programme to extend our work to protect the vital marine ecosystems in conservation areas in overseas territories. And don’t forget Britain has the fifth biggest marine estate in the world. If we don’t act now our children and our grandchildren will never know a world with the Great Barrier Reef, or the Sumatran Tiger or the Black Rhino. And so next year at the biodiversity COP – the Summit in China – the so called aichi targets must, in our view, be replaced with new, more ambitious targets to help us get back the biodiversity that this planet is losing, and has lost. And I’m pleased that the G7 Summit today in Biarritz has accepted those UK ideas, those proposals for biodiversity targets, for humanity to set targets to stop the reduction of habitats and species. And obviously we are going to follow up on that at the COP Summit in the UK if we’re lucky enough to get that and I very much believe that we will. There’s one issue underpinning all that which I believe holds the key to tackling so many global problems and that is the vital importance of educating girls and I’m very pleased that here at the G7 people, everybody, every delegation has supported the UK’s campaign to give every girl in the world 12 years of quality education. Today I announced funding to give 600,000 children in the world’s most dangerous countries, where girls are twice as likely as boys to be out of school, the opportunity to go to school for the first time. We discussed Iran, and we are all agreed that Iran should never under any circumstances be allowed to get a nuclear weapon. And there is clearly an opportunity for Iran to now come back into compliance with a nuclear deal – the JCPOA – and to resume dialogue as well as to cease its disruptive behaviour in the region. We expressed, collectively, deep concern about what is happening in Hong Kong, and the G7 nations all want to support a stable and a prosperous Hong Kong. And we remain collectively committed to the one country two systems framework. And I was pleased that was reflected in the conclusions of the Summit, which was as I say very productive indeed. People can quarrel with Summits and with world leaders coming together in this way for discussions about the wide ranging issues we have had – but I really think that if the leaders who have been gathered together in Biarritz over the last couple of days really follow through on these discussions, and really mean what they say in the conclusions, I think it will make a real difference to the issues that the people in our country care very deeply about. So I thank you very much for sticking with it. I know it’s been a long old Summit, but I’d like to take your questions now."
"Boris Johnson","Prime Minister's statement: 2 September 2019","2 September 2019","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-statement-2-september-2019","Five weeks ago I spoke to you from these steps and said that this Government was not going to hang around and that we would not wait until brexit day - October 31 - to deliver on the priorities of the British people. And so I am proud to say that on Wednesday Chancellor Sajid Javid is going to set out the most ambitious spending round for more than a decade. I said I wanted to make your streets safer - and that is why we are recruiting another 20,000 police officers. I said I wanted to improve your hospital and reduce the waiting times at your GP. And so we are doing 20 new hospital upgrades in addition to the extra £34 billion going into the NHS. And I said I wanted every child in this country to have a superb education and that’s why I announced last week that we are levelling up funding across the country and spending much more next year in both primary and secondary schools. And it is to push forward this agenda on these and many other fronts that we need a Queen’s speech in October. While leaving due time to debate brexit and other matters. And as we come to that brexit deadline I am encouraged by the progress we are making. In the last few weeks the chances of a deal have been rising, I believe, for three reasons. They can see that we want a deal. They can see that we have a clear vision for our future relationship with the EU - something that has perhaps not always been the case. And they can see that we are utterly determined to strengthen our position by getting ready to come out regardless, come what may But if there is one thing that can hold us back in these talks it is the sense in Brussels that MPs may find some way to cancel the referendum [Political content removed] I don’t think they will. I hope that they won’t But if they do they will plainly chop the legs out from under the UK position and make any further negotiation absolutely impossible [Political content removed] I want everybody to know – there are no circumstances in which I will ask Brussels to delay. We are leaving on 31 October, no ifs or buts. We will not accept any attempt to go back on our promises or scrub that referendum Armed and fortified with that conviction I believe we will get a deal at that crucial summit in October A deal that parliament will certainly be able to scrutinise And in the meantime let our negotiators get on with their work Without that sword of Damocles over their necks And without an election, which I don’t want and you don’t want Let us get on with the people’s agenda - fighting crime, improving the NHS, boosting schools, cutting the cost of living, and unlocking talent and opportunity across the entire United Kingdom With infrastructure education and technology It is a massive agenda. Let’s come together and get it done - and let’s get Brexit done by October 31."
"Boris Johnson","PM statement on G7 Summit: 3 September 2019","3 September 2019","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-statement-on-g7-summit-3-september-2019","Mr Speaker, before I begin, I am sure that the whole House will join me in remembering that it is 80 years today that this country entered the Second World War. And though it is of course true that the horror of that conflict surpasses all modern controversies, it is also true that this country still stands then as now for democracy, for the rule of law, for the fight against racial and religious hatred, and Mr Speaker I know that this House is united in defending those values around the world. Mr Speaker, with permission I will make a statement about the G7 summit in Biarritz. As I speak, vast tracts of the Amazon rainforest are on fire, free trade is in retreat, 130 million girls worldwide are not in education, our oceans are being foully polluted, And so it has never been more important for a Global Britain to use our voice as an agent of change and progress. It is only by exerting our influence at a global level, only by sticking up for our values and beliefs, that we can create the international context for Britain to prosper, and to ensure that this is greatest place on earth to live, to work, to start a family, open a business, trade and invest. And so, at the G7, I made the case for free trade as an engine of prosperity and progress that has lifted billions out of poverty. And yet the reality is that trade as a share of the world economy has been stagnant for the last decade. In the Leaders’ Declaration, the G7 unanimously endorsed “open and fair world trade”; and we’re determined to reform the World Trade Organisation and reach agreement next year to “simplify regulatory barriers”. Britain is on the verge Mr Speaker, of taking back control of our trade policy and restoring our independent seat in the WTO for the first time in 46 years. And we could achieve even more in our trade with the United States by using the powers we will regain to do a comprehensive free trade deal, a deal in which President Trump and I have both agreed that the NHS is not on the table. [Political content removed] Mr Speaker, I know that the whole House will share my concern about the gravity of the situation in Hong Kong. As a nation with a deep belief in freedom of expression and assembly, we stand firm in upholding Hong Kong’s way of life, guaranteed by one country, two systems. And I welcome the unwavering support of my G7 counterparts on this vital matter. Mr Speaker the UK is at the forefront of a new campaign to end the tragic loss of species around the world. We cannot bequeath a planet where the Sumatran Tiger and the African Elephant and entire ecosystems like the Great Barrier Reef live in the shadow of destruction. So I am delighted that the G7 accepted UK proposals for more ambitious targets to halt and reverse the loss of biodiversity. Britain is responsible for 2.6 million square miles of ocean – the fifth largest maritime estate in the world. Our Blue Belt programme will ensure that marine protected areas encompass 1.5 million square miles and, at the G7, I announced a further £7 million for this vital effort. I also announced another £10 million to protect the rainforest in Brazil, where 41,000 fires have raged so far this year, more than twice as many as in the same period in 2018. Britain is bidding to host the UN’s 26th Climate Change Conference next year. If we succeed, we shall focus on solutions that harness the power of nature, including reforestation. [Political content removed] There is one measure that would address all those issues and that is ensuring that every girl in the world receives the education that is her right. This would not only curb infant mortality, eradicate illiteracy and reduce population pressures, it would strike a blow for morality and justice. In Biarritz, the G7 therefore endorsed the UK’s campaign for 12 years of quality education for every girl in the world. And I announced new funding of £90 million so that 600,000 children in countries torn by conflict – where girls are twice as likely as boys to be out of the classroom – get the chance to go to school. And as well as my G7 colleagues, I was delighted to meet other leaders, including President Ramaphosa of South Africa, Prime Minister Modi of India, And Prime Minister Morrison of Australia who heroically masked his emotions in the face of the historic innings of Ben Stokes. In every conversation, I was struck by the enthusiasm of my colleagues to strengthen their relations with this country, whether on trade, security and defence, science and technology. Mr Speaker, I was also able to use the G7 to follow up my conversations in Berlin and Paris with Chancellor Merkel and President Macron on Brexit, as well with Prime Minister Conte, Prime Minister Sanchez, and President Tusk. I have since spoken to Commission President Juncker, and many other leaders. And I was able to make clear to them all that everyone in this government wants a deal. But it is a reality that the House of Commons has rejected the current Withdrawal Agreement three times and it simply cannot be resurrected. That is why I wrote to President Tusk on the 19th August to set out our arguments why any future Agreement must include the abolition of the anti-democratic backstop. We have also been clear that we will need changes to the Political Declaration, to clarify that our future relationship with the EU will be based on a Free Trade Agreement, and giving us full control over our regulations, our trade, and our foreign and defence policy. This clarity has brought benefits. Far from jeopardising negotiations, it is making them more straightforward. In the last few weeks, I believe the chances of a deal have risen. This week we are intensifying the pace of meetings in Brussels. Our European friends can see that we want an agreement. And they are beginning to reflect that reality in their response. President Macron said if, I quote, Mr. Speaker, they don’t want to hear the words of our counterparts across the Channel, they don’t want to hear about any progress that we might be making, they don’t. Mr Speaker, I think they are wilfully closing their ears to the reality that our friends and partners are increasingly seeing the possibilities of an agreement and again I quote President Macron of France: “If there are things which, as part of what was negotiated by Michel Barnier, can be adapted and are in keeping with the two objectives I’ve just mentioned – stability in Ireland which we all support and the integrity of the single market – we should identify them in the coming months.” [Political content removed] And speaking in Berlin of possible alternatives to the backstop, Chancellor Merkel of Germany said: “Once we see and say this could be a possible outcome, this could be a possible arrangement, this backstop is a sort of placeholder which is no longer necessary”, she said. [Political content removed]. I believe there are indeed solutions. [Political content removed] There are practical arrangements that we can find which avoid anyone putting infrastructure on the Irish border. These have been well worked out and involve measures such as trusted trader schemes, transit provisions, frontier zones, reduced bureaucracy for small and local traders, and many others. In particular, we recognise and I advise the Members opposite to pay attention to what is being said. We recognise that for reasons of geography and economics, agrifood is increasingly managed on a common basis across the island of Ireland. We are ready to find ways forward that recognise this reality, provided it clearly enjoys the consent of all parties and institutions with an interest. We will also be discussing all this with the EU shortly and I will be discussing it with the Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, when I see him in Dublin on Monday. Mr Speaker, it is simply wrong to say we are not making progress. There is a lot to do in the coming days. But things are moving. A major reason for that is that everyone can see this government is utterly determined to leave the EU on 31 October, come what may, without a deal if necessary. And that is why over the summer my RH Friend the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster has been leading the government’s efforts, seven days a week, to accelerate our national preparations for this possibility. And he will be making a statement on that subject shortly. My RH Friend the Chancellor has made all the necessary funds available. We have already reached agreements with our partners to roll over trade deals worth around £89 billion of exports and imports. We have secured air services agreements around the world. We have increased the capacity of our Border Force, strengthened the resilience of our ports, bolstered our freight capacity, and worked with meticulous detail to ensure the uninterrupted supply of critical goods, including medicines. We will be ready, Mr Speaker. Mr Speaker, I returned from the G7 with real momentum in the Brexit discussions. Mr Speaker, I want to return from next month’s European Council in a similar way, with a deal that this House can debate and scrutinise and endorse in time for our departure on October 31st. But Mr Speaker, there is one step that would jeopardise all the progress that we have made at the G7 and around the capitals of Europe. And that is if this House were to decide that it was simply impossible for us to leave without a deal. And to make that step illegal. That’s what they want, to force us to beg for yet another pointless delay. If that happens, all the progress that we have been making will have been for nothing. Yesterday Mr Speaker, a Bill was published – a Bill that the leader of the Opposition has spent all summer working on. This is not a Bill in any normal sense of the word. It is without precedent in our history – it is a Bill that, if passed, would force me to go to Brussels and beg an extension. It would force me to accept any terms offered. It would destroy any chance of negotiations or a new deal. And indeed it would enable our friends in Brussels to dictate the terms of the negotiation, that is what it does. [Political content removed] It means running up the white flag. I want to make clear to everybody in this House – there are no circumstances in which I will ever accept anything like it. [Political content removed] Mr Speaker, we promised the people we would get Brexit done. We promised to respect the result of the referendum and we must do so now. Enough is enough. This country wants this done. They want the referendum respected. We are negotiating a deal and though I am confident of getting a deal we will leave on 31 October in all circumstances. There will be no further pointless delay. This House has never before voted to force the Prime Minister to surrender such a crucial decision to the discretion of our friends and neighbours overseas. What is this bill would mean is that unless we agree to the terms of our friends and partners they would be able to keep us in the EU for as long as they want and on their terms. I urge therefore this House to reject this Bill tonight so that we can get the right deal for our country, deliver Brexit and take the whole country forward. And I commend this statement to the House."
"Boris Johnson","A Commonwealth of common values: address by Laura Clarke","3 September 2019","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/a-commonwealth-of-common-values","E ngā mana, e ngā iwi, e ngā reo. Tēnā koutou, tēnā koutou, tēnā koutou katoa. It is a pleasure to be here tonight, addressing the Royal Commonwealth Society – so kia ora and thank you for the invitation. There is a strong and long-standing relationship between the British High Commission and the RCS, and I know that I follow in the footsteps of many of my predecessors in addressing you today. The title of this lecture is ‘A Commonwealth of Common Values’. This has given me a fairly wide remit, which I aim to exploit to the full extent possible! But before getting into specifics, I would like to set the scene a little. Members of the Royal Commonwealth Society will be well versed in most of this but I think it well worth revisiting the fundamentals of the Commonwealth, and some key facts and statistics – because they really are quite remarkable. From an original family of 8 states (including New Zealand) who signed the London Declaration in 1949, the Commonwealth has grown to 53 member states. Mozambique and Rwanda were the first countries to be admitted to the Commonwealth that were not previously part of the British Empire (you’ll note by my use of the word first that we hope there will be more!). We also welcomed Gambia back into the family in February last year, and the Republic of Maldives has requested to re-join. The fact that a growing number of nations are keen to join or re-join the Commonwealth demonstrates the value that countries place on the benefits of being part of our diverse family. These 53 member states are home to 2.4 billion people – a third of the world’s population, across a quarter of the UN member states. In terms of prosperity, the Commonwealth makes up one-fifth of global trade, with the combined GDP of Commonwealth nations set to reach US$13 trillion in 2020. Commonwealth States make up a quarter of the G20 group of countries. The potential of the Commonwealth is therefore vast. As the current Chair-in-Office, the United Kingdom is working with all member states to ensure the Commonwealth realises that potential. We are focussed on promoting democratic values and development, increasing trade, amplifying the voices of small states, and tackling global challenges such as extremism and climate change. Of course, all of this is easier said than done, and I don’t want to gloss over the challenges that exist with this diverse set of nations. As with any multilateral organisation or any family, different personalities, priorities and inter-family relationships mean that there are tensions and difficulties. I will get into some more detail on these challenges later on. But I think it’s important to acknowledge the role of a common set of values and principles can play in resolving differences – or at the very least provide a basis for a constructive dialogue. So, with that scene set, I’d like to talk to you about three topics that I think are important to consider when thinking about the Commonwealth and its values: What the common values that bind together this family of diverse nations? What are the challenges that we face? And what does the Commonwealth mean here in New Zealand, in the Pacific and for the UK? Common values The 16 shared values of the nations of the Commonwealth are set out clearly in our Charter. You will be relieved to hear that I will not be going through in detail how each of the 53 nations implement all 16 of those values – we don’t have all night, and I am a diplomat, not an anti-insomnia app. But broadly speaking those Commonwealth values can be summed up as a belief in democracy and the rule of law, good governance and human rights. The Charter also expresses the commitment of member states to the development of free and democratic societies and the promotion of peace and prosperity to improve the lives of all peoples of the Commonwealth. Our common values, read together, represent our vision of common solutions to common problems, and working within the rules-based international order. I would like this evening to highlight some of those values that have particular resonance for me, and which I think will have a critical role in how the Commonwealth evolves. Firstly, human rights and equality The starting point is that, only if human rights are protected – at an individual and collective level – can a country and its citizens fulfil its true potential. If some people are discriminated against or denied a role in decision making, or if the rule of law is not consistently and predictably applied, then both the people and the nation (and the economy) will suffer. So it’s a no-brainer (to use the technical term) that the Commonwealth is active on human rights. The Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in the UK last year recognised the importance of sharing human rights best practice and expertise; and agreed to support National Human Rights Institutions in each country, and enable effective participation by Commonwealth states in the Universal Periodic Review process at the Human Rights Council. The UK is – to that end – funding two new Geneva-based advisors, to support Commonwealth member states’ engagement with the Universal Periodic Review and the Human Rights Council. Closer to home, here in the Pacific, the UK and the Secretariat for Pacific Communities launched the Pacific Commonwealth Equality Project in Kiribati just last year. With £1.8 million of UK funding, this joint initiative will improve the capacity of Pacific Commonwealth countries to deliver on their international human rights commitments. There have been smaller-scale projects, too: in Samoa, for example, the other Commonwealth state to which I am accredited, the Commonwealth Secretariat has supported the critical work of the National Ombudsman in documenting and communicating the problem of domestic violence. The Commonwealth, in all its diversity, also champions religious freedom. But this year’s heinous attacks on mosques in New Zealand and churches in Sri Lanka, and the ongoing persecution of or discrimination against religious minorities in many countries, including Commonwealth countries, remind us – afresh – of our shared responsibility to uphold and protect this fundamental human right to freedom of religion or belief. Protection of the environment As members of the Commonwealth, we share a recognition that we live on a shared planet with finite, common resources that must be managed for the benefit of all. And that we have a duty of kaitiakitanga, or guardianship, for our land and oceans. Here in the Pacific, I don’t need to set out the imminent, existential threat that climate change poses to many, eventually all, of our members. I don’t need to remind you of the Prime Minister of Tuvalu’s rallying cry: that if you save Tuvalu, you save the world. And I don’t need – I think – to set out the plight of our oceans and marine life, faced with temperature rises, over-fishing, and pollution. But it’s worth setting out what we are doing to tackle the problem. At the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting last year, we celebrated the ratification of the Paris Agreement by all members. We re-iterated our commitment to pursue efforts to limit the increase in global average temperature to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. And we launched the Commonwealth Blue Charter to sustainably develop and protect the ocean, along with initiatives such as the Commonwealth Marine Economy Programme, and the Commonwealth Clean Oceans Alliance. Our task now is to focus on delivery. Here in the Pacific region, the UK is supporting the establishment of a Regional Pacific Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) Hub in Fiji to help the Pacific Island Countries implement the Paris Agreement. New Zealand announced similar support in the margins of COP 24 in Poland. In June the UK launched the first ever Pacific Climate Change Report Card on World Oceans Day. In collaboration with UK marine scientists, 60 Pacific Climate Change experts worked to assess the impact of climate change in the region and identify how Pacific islands can respond to this global challenge. Since its launch with 7 countries in April last year, 25 countries have now signed up to the UK and Vanuatu led “Commonwealth Clean Oceans Alliance” to tackle marine plastic pollution. I was at the meeting of the Pacific Community in Noumea in June of this year, and Pacific country after Pacific country set out what they are doing to reduce the use of plastics and tackle plastic pollution. And – as the proud Governor of the Pitcairn Islands, I am pleased to say that they, too, are playing their part, with an expedition to Henderson Island to clear up plastic pollution, study its impact, and communicate the plight of plastic pollution to the world. None of these problems can be tackled by countries acting alone: we need to co-operate and draw on the contribution and expertise of all our members. And none of them can be tackled by government alone: we need leadership at every level – large states and small, governments and individuals - to deliver the culture change and action necessary. So, in line with the Charter’s principle to recognise the needs of small states, the UK at CHOGM announced a £19m package of support for Small Island Developing States to strengthen pre and post-disaster financing plans, as part of our efforts to support the resilience and prosperity of Small Island Developing States. In November last year, the UK helped to fund Small Island Developing States from across the Commonwealth to attend Kenya’s Sustainable Blue Economy Conference, to compare notes on how best to manage oceans sustainably. And in September, the Prime Minister announced a Young Leaders’ Plastic Challenge Badge to help an estimated 100,000 young people in the Commonwealth become leaders in raising awareness about reducing plastic consumption. Which brings me to the third value I would like to highlight: The importance of young people in the Commonwealth One in three of all young people aged between 15 and 29 live Commonwealth countries. That’s about 640 million young people. We have all seen the power of young voices leading change – Greta Thunberg is but one example - and I am sure you will agree that our youth are a vital and valuable investment for now and the future. 60% of the population of our member countries are under the age of 30. One of the roles of the Commonwealth is to amplify the voice of young people and for 40 years the Commonwealth Youth Programme has supported member countries to do just that. It places special emphasis on supporting young people to design and drive youth-led initiatives across a range of issues that directly affect them. A great example of this is the Commonwealth Youth Climate Change Network (CYCN) which was established in 2009 to build the capacity of young people in their endeavours to address climate change and other environmental issues, and advocate on climate change from a youth perspective. The Commonwealth Youth Climate Change Network supports actions that empower young people to translate climate change programmes into effective policies that will have a measurable impact on youth well-being. It also links projects implemented by its members across the Commonwealth in order to develop common actions and campaigns. For the UK to reach its legally binding target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to Net Zero by 2050, and for all countries committed to meeting – or exceeding – their Paris commitments, it is key that we engage the drive & ambition of our youth. The Commonwealth provides a great platform for doing so. A further example is the Commonwealth Children and Youth Disability Network. Launched this year, the network aims to enable young disabled people to effect change on issues that matter to them. This is a practical response to the Commonwealth Heads of Government mandate to ‘address the stigmas around disability in all its forms and manifestations, ensuring that no one is left behind’. This network gives a voice and space to children and young people with disabilities to lead their own agenda in the Commonwealth. It is also essential to recognise and celebrate the achievements of these young people whose initiatives range from poverty alleviation to peace building. In 2018, Josevata Rotidara (Jo-say-fa-ta Row-ti-fara) from Fiji was a finalist in the Commonwealth Youth Awards in recognition of his inspiring work as an advocate for ‘Campaign for Mental Health’, and his efforts to promote well-being and overcome the stigma that surrounds mental health. The award was won by Usman Iftikhar from Australia, who founded a start up incubator that enables migrants and refugees in Australia to start their own businesses. By showcasing and celebrating the achievements of young people in driving democracy and development, the Youth Awards inspire a whole new generation of Commonwealth leaders. Challenges Of course, it’s not all a bed of roses – and it’s worth reflecting on (rather than glossing over) the challenges facing the Commonwealth. Some of these are about our internal governance – how the large programme budget is spent, or the multiplicity of issues we discuss, and the risk of duplicating discussions in other fora. Over time, the Commonwealth has gained a reputation for being a talking shop. The donor-recipient / north-south dynamic pervades, as can talk of the Old Commonwealth and the New. Controversial decisions, such as allowing Sri Lanka to host CHOGM in 2013 despite concerns about human rights abuses, have fuelled criticism of the organisation and its ability to take decisive action on pressing issues. More generally, there is a gap between the Commonwealth’s emphasis on human rights, and the reality on the ground in many member states: whether that’s the rights of women or members of the LGBTI community, religious and ethnic minorities, or ensuring a level playing field for political parties. And the Commonwealth’s tools for holding members to account are limited. I was working on South Asia in 2016, when the Republic of the Maldives, tired of being scrutinised and criticised by the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group for its failings on human rights, decided to leave the Commonwealth. There are also tensions between members: for example between India and Pakistan, which can complicate the dynamic within the organisation. And the UK is not immune: we are engaged in a long-running dialogue with Mauritius about the sovereignty of the British Indian Ocean Territory. But our shared values that we all signed up to in the Commonwealth Charter, and reaffirmed last year, mean that even as we may disagree on specific issues, we are able to continue civil and productive relationships with fellow members. We can also agree – as we did in Malta, and in London – on the need for reform, and work together on that reform. That’s how a family of nations works. And it is a testament to the success of this imperfect family that the Republic of the Maldives, under its new Government, has submitted a request to re-join the Commonwealth. What does the Commonwealth mean here in New Zealand, in the Pacific and for the UK? I’ve talked a lot about climate change, oceans and human rights, here in the Pacific region. But I would expect that most Kiwis (current audience probably excepted) would have trouble identifying what benefits New Zealand derives from being a member of the Commonwealth. Explaining what the Commonwealth is and how it benefits its members is an ongoing challenge. There is a low level of understanding of the Commonwealth in all our countries – as any High Commissioner will testify. As the outgoing Indian High Commissioner put it: my Mother wants to know when I’ll be promoted to Ambassador… And yet the tangible benefits of membership are considerable. You may have heard of the ‘Commonwealth Advantage’. This is used to describe the fact that trade between Commonwealth members costs on average 19% less than trade with non-members. This is largely thanks to the close relationships and common factors between our countries, such as use of the English language and similar legal and financial systems. With intra-Commonwealth trade expected to rise to $700 billion in 2020 and a commitment made by leaders at CHOGM 2018 to raise that to $2 trillion by 2030 through the Commonwealth Connectivity Agenda for Trade and Investment, there is enormous advantage for a trading nation like New Zealand to be part of the family. Indeed, DPM/FM Peters has established a Commonwealth Trade Envoy, Jeremy Clarke-Watson to ensure that New Zealand is taking maximum advantage of its membership, and to look at how that advantage might be enhanced. Given our similarities of language and legal systems, the Commonwealth is a perfect test-bed to try out exciting, innovative new measures on trade, such as enabling digital trade, finding new ways of addressing regulatory barriers or using trade for development purposes. But wider than trading links, the Commonwealth is an amazing network of people for New Zealand and the other members to engage with. With 2.4 billion people spread across 53 countries, the Commonwealth encompasses an extraordinarily wide geographic, cultural, ethnic and economic diversity. Normally multilateral fora are focussed on one region or theme, for example, ASEAN and APEC. But the Commonwealth is spread across the globe with the Pacific, African, European, and Caribbean nations meeting to address a diverse set of issues, but all underpinned by this common set of values and principles. In no other forum would the Prime Minister of Samoa sit next to the Prime Minister of India, or – I suspect – the Prime Minister of New Zealand next to the Prime Minister of Nigeria. If you haven’t seen the video message that Prime Minister Ardern recorded for Facebook from the tarmac at Heathrow on her way home from the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in London last year (22 April 2018), it’s well worth a watch. You’ll see for yourself how enthusiastic she was about the range of leaders she was able to interact with. Leaders that she wouldn’t normally have had the chance to speak to. She mentioned conversations with the leaders of Botswana, South Africa, Malta and Sri Lanka. She spoke about small islands interacting with large states, and in turn persuading them of the scale of the challenge that climate change poses to Island nations. But she also repeatedly used the word potential: and that’s right. we have work to do to realise fully the potential of the Commonwealth. The Pacific Looking now to the vast Pacific region, here too the connections are close. The Commonwealth and the shared values that I have just described bring us together. Nine Pacific islands are fellow members of the Commonwealth, and our connections – for good or ill – stem from Captain Cook’s first voyage through the Pacific 250 years ago this year. So the UK has long been in and of the Pacific. But in the 2000s we scaled down our presence. We remained present and engaged in Fiji, PNG, and the Solomon Islands. But we closed our High Commissions in Vanuatu and Tonga, and quite frankly we stepped back too much from our Pacific friends and Commonwealth partners in this region. We are now putting that right. At the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting last year, the then Foreign Secretary, now our Prime Minister Boris Johnson, announced that the UK would be opening 9 new diplomatic missions in Commonwealth countries, thereby increasing the number of British High Commissions around the world from 38 to 47. Three of those new missions are in the Pacific: we are opening High Commissions in Tonga, Vanuatu and Samoa, thereby doubling our diplomatic presence in the Pacific. And while – on a personal note - I’ll be sad to give up my non-resident High Commissioner position to Samoa, it’s something that I advocated strongly for, and it’s brilliant that we will have a new resident High Commissioner arriving in December. Because there is so much more we can do together: in the region, and in the Commonwealth as a whole. And we very much hope that the Commonwealth may be coming to the Pacific: at CHOGM 2018, Heads welcomed the offer of Samoa to host CHOGM 2022. A final decision will be made at CHOGM 2020 in Rwanda, but we are excited at the prospect of working with Samoa in this vein, and of course with other countries in the region – New Zealand included. The UK And what about the UK? Having got this far without mentioning the B word – I should now talk about what Brexit means – and doesn’t mean – in this context. It’s important to stress that, while we are indeed leaving a multinational organisation, the UK is neither nationalist, nor isolationist. We remain proudly multicultural, and proudly internationalist. Some saw Brexit as a sign that the UK would turn in on itself, putting up barriers to international co-operation. But the UK has been clear throughout that it will remain as active and engaged internationally as ever. We are clear that though we are leaving the EU, we are not leaving Europe: we aim to maintain the closest possible relationships with our European partners, friends and neighbours. We are clear that we believe strongly in global responses to global problems: championing free trade, taking urgent action to protect our climate and oceans, tackling the scourges of terrorism, cyber attacks and hostile states. We are bidding – in partnership with Italy – to host COP 26, the UN Climate Change Conference, in 2020. We remain focussed on human rights and good governance. And we continue to put our money where our mouth is: we are the only NATO member to spend both 2% of GDP on collective defence, and 0.7% on ODA. We are – in short - re-invigorating our ties with old friends and partners across the globe – and investing time, energy and money, as I have set out, in making the Commonwealth as effective as possible. That’s why we were particularly proud to host last year’s Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in London last year on the 70th anniversary of our network, and we remain a committed champion of the organisation as Chair-in-Office for this year of ‘A Connected Commonwealth’. Conclusion To conclude. The UK shaped the world dramatically through colonialism and the British Empire. And our history of Empire – with all the baggage that brings – is also the story of our modern diversity, and British citizens who whakapapa to Commonwealth countries around the world. Whatever we may think of the Empire and its legacy, and that surely is a topic for another speech on another occasion - the ties that are left are strong. A shared language, shared legal system, shared values. The connections between our peoples – what Prime Minister Modi calls the “living bridge”. A feeling of being at home in each others’ countries. That, Ladies in Gentlemen, is now the Commonwealth: a diverse family of nations who, by virtue of those historical, cultural and people to people connections, by virtue of shared values, and by virtue of a shared commitment to finding global solutions to global problems, choose – actively choose - to be part of the Commonwealth. In May 1949, 70 years ago, Prime Minister Nehru set out why, as it became a Republic India was committed to being a part of the Commonwealth: We join the Commonwealth because we think it is beneficial to us and to certain causes in the world that we wish to advance. It is mutually understood that it is to the advantage of the nations in the Commonwealth and therefore they join. At the same time, it is made perfectly clear that each country is completely free to go its own way… but it is better to keep a co-operative association going which may do good in this world rather than break it. And that, Ladies and Gentlemen, remains as true today as it was then: the Commonwealth, in all its imperfection, is beneficial to its members, and it is a force for doing good in the world. Tēnā koutou, tēnā koutou, tēnā koutou katoa."
"Boris Johnson","New British High Commissioner to Kenya presents credentials: speech by Jane Marriott","3 September 2019","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/speech-by-the-new-british-high-commissioner","Your Excellency, I have the honour to present the warmest compliments and greetings from Her Majesty the Queen, Prime Minister Johnson and the people of the United Kingdom to you personally and through you to the people of Kenya. This country holds a very special place in the heart of Her Majesty and in those of Her family and so many of Her subjects in the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom’s relationship with Kenya is a strategic one, based on deep respect, partnership and mutual interest. We must live with, and honour, our shared history, and the pains and joys that it has brought. And we also recognise that these experiences have resulted in deep connections between our peoples, our Governments and our businesses. Our present and our future are intertwined. We stand today as two vibrant and modern countries, crucial to the success of our respective regions and with important roles in the Commonwealth and in supporting the rules-based international system. We are each safer and more prosperous when the other is so. The United Kingdom is, therefore, deeply committed to supporting your agenda on The Big Four – affordable housing, food security, manufacturing and universal healthcare. The Africa Investment Summit in 2020 provides further impetus to support this agenda and in helping you deliver a dynamic business environment that welcomes international trade and investment. I hope also, as High Commissioner, to work with Your Excellency and Your government to deliver a strengthened strategic partnership between our countries: a boost to our economic partnership following the UK’s departure from the European Union, our strengthened and mutually beneficial security and defence partnership, including in the fight against Al Shabaab, and a climate partnership to tackle the generational challenge of our time, where Kenya can lead the way. I would also like to pay our respects to the continued commitment and sacrifice of your security and defence forces and society leaders who fight against extremism and terrorism. I have the honour to present to Your Excellency the Letter of Recall of my Predecessor and my Credentials by which Her Majesty the Queen has appointed me to be the next High Commissioner of the United Kingdom to the Republic of Kenya."
"Boris Johnson","International Trade Dinner speech","5 September 2019","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/international-trade-dinner-speech","Good evening – I’m delighted to welcome our honoured guests, Vice President Pence and Mrs Pence, Ambassador Johnson and Mrs Johnson. They are huge friends of Britain and I’m thrilled that they are able to join us tonight. Firstly, I want to thank my predecessor, Liam Fox, who has done so much brilliant work on trade and tonight’s event. I also want to thank all our wonderful trade commissioners and trade envoys, many of whom are here tonight, with a particular welcome to Baroness Neville-Rolfe who has recently been appointed as Chair of our UK Asian Business Council. And finally, I would like to thank the Lord Mayor and the City of London Corporation for inviting me to speak to you this evening in the fabulous surroundings of London’s Guildhall. This Hall has witnessed two very important speeches from the US: President Eisenhower in 1945 as the Second World War was ending, and President Reagan in 1988, after his historic meeting with Gorbachev. Both speeches trumpeted the vital importance of free trade in developing a strong, free, democratic world. After 1945 it was the UK and US who together created the modern trading systems which have hugely enriched our lives. We banged the drum for free markets and democracy and proved the merits of our way of life in stark contrast with communism, which had failed its citizens. We saw Chairman Mao’s oppressive regime begin to fall with his death. We saw the Iron Curtain torn down in Eastern Europe, and a new era of trading and commercial freedom begin. When President Reagan addressed the Hall in 1988 he made the case for freedom and free markets. He said: “We have learned the first objective of the adversaries of freedom is to make free nations question their own faith in freedom, to make us think that adhering to our principles and speaking out against human rights abuses or foreign aggression is somehow an act of belligerence.” President Reagan was clear that in order to defend freedom you cannot afford to stay silent. And our honoured guest Vice President Pence has done so much to champion freedom in the United States and beyond. Mr Vice-President, you have a consistent record as Governor of Indiana in giving people more freedom over their own lives, through cutting taxes, boosting voucher programmes and setting up charter schools, similar to our free schools here in the UK. 1945 and 1988 were two crucial moments in which our two nations defended freedom. I want 2019 to be remembered as another great year, when the US and UK again joined forces to make the case for freedom across the world. The City of London encapsulates free trade; it’s the financial capital of the world and provides the lifeblood to the global financial system, allowing trade to happen. We’re the highest net exporter of financial services and we sell more products around the world than any other country. This is only going to grow. You can see by the number of cranes, and the fact that the City of London’s skyscrapers are just about joining up with Canary Wharf’s, that this is a City on the rise. And this great Hall is at the centre of it all. But why did London achieved this global dominance? It’s partly down to the Conservative radical Margaret Thatcher, who liberalised the City in the 1980s and ended restrictive practices. She understood the power of free markets and presided over the Big Bang in 1986 when she slashed the restrictions that had gripped the City in a choke-hold for too long. The City went from being a closed shop to an international trading powerhouse. It also unleashed talent from beyond the usual suspects to a huge variety of people from all over Britain to enter the City. Thirty-three years later the UK has another golden opportunity to open the doors to a new wave of liberalisation. I want 2019 to be the year that the UK became a world leader in trade liberalisation. I want 2019 to be the year that UK businesses of all shapes and sizes burst out onto the world stage. And I want 2019 to be the year that the UK reinvents itself as a trading nation. Many people think of trade as an abstract concept, but it’s not. It goes to the very heart of people’s lives and livelihoods. Trade is the teenager selling through their online YouTube channel; it’s the engineer in Sunderland building new cars; it’s the farmer in Wales, raising their lamb. Trade is the engine on which societies grow and prosper. It gives you the ownership of your own produce, your own actions and your own future. [Political content] But ladies and gentlemen, the proof is there for all to see. Increased economic freedom has done more than anything else to help those at the bottom. Over the last three decades, free trade has lifted more than 1 billion people out of poverty. And our great countries – two of the freest, most democratic, open nations in the world – have been on the front line setting the example for others to follow. But we can’t afford to sit back; we need to make the case again for free enterprise and free trade in the new era. I grew up in the 1980s and saw Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan win the argument through confidence in our values, and their refusal to submit to the idea of moral relativism. They took on the arguments to bring about the end of the Soviet Union and they launched an economic revival that transformed our standing in the world. Both leaders entered office with similar problems: sluggish growth, high interest rates, inflation and a growing demand for self-destructive protectionism. The doomsters, gloomsters and fearmongers made the same tired arguments that they continue to trot out today: that Britain’s best days were behind us; that Britain was too small to be independent; that Britain was destined to fail. Well, that wasn’t true then and it isn’t true now. President Reagan and Mrs Thatcher set about renewing our national identities and giving us our confidence back. They cut taxes, slayed inflation and unleashed a remarkable period of Anglo/American and global growth. Together they helped win the battle against the concept of the oppressive totalitarian state. The success we have witnessed as a result had been driven by the power of free enterprise – by free people in competition. As we leave the European Union on 31st October there is new energy behind our partnership spurred on by our shared values and a new technological revolution. There’s a reason why the US and UK lead the world in this regard: It’s only in a free society underpinned by a belief in free speech that you will generate the cutting-edge ideas and make great leaps forward. It was a Brit – Sir Tim Berners Lee – who invented the World Wide Web, and the technology grew up in Silicon Valley. Today our cross-border cooperation is oiling the wheels of trade in everything from video games to state-of-the art computer design, to the latest breakthroughs in drugs and pharmaceuticals, aircraft, plastics and chemicals. Together our two countries are the ideas factory of the world, and it is within our gift to strike the most comprehensive free trade agreement that’s ever been done. And I’m committed as Trade Secretary to do just that. I believe it will be one that sets the standard across the world and challenges those who are pushing state-owned enterprise and intellectual property theft. New battle lines have been drawn between free people living in free economies, and those where the state alone has its hands on the levers of power. And by leaving the EU the UK will be in a stronger position to defend our principles. For the first time in 40 years we will be able to set our own independent trade policy that works for the whole of the UK. We will be able to enter agreements with other countries such as Japan and South Korea, and renew our historic ties with friends in the Commonwealth, including Canada, Australia and New Zealand. But the largest opportunity of all lies with our closest ally and biggest trading partner – the United States of America. The future is bright. This is the year we will throw open our doors to free trade agreements with the rest of the world. I believe that both the UK and US’s best days are ahead of us. I believe that by working together as free-market democracies we will continue to lead the debate in the world. I believe there are huge opportunities before us that will enhance the prosperity and freedom of our people. It is 33 years since the Big Bang of 1986: let’s make 2019 the Big Bang year of free trade."
"Boris Johnson","PM press statement with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar: 9 September 2019","9 September 2019","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-press-statement-with-taoiseach-leo-varadkar-9-september-2019","Thank you Leo and it is wonderful to be here. And I thank you very much for the warm welcome you’ve given us. You and I first met a few years ago when you and I jointly officiated at the St Patrick’s Day parade in Trafalgar square in London. It was a pretty joyous occasion. And of course we celebrated the incalculable contribution of the Irish community to London. And there in the vast crowds was of course the living human embodiment of one of the densest and most intricate and most vital relationships in the world between any two countries. And together Leo today we both recognise that our peoples are the beneficiaries of the efforts of our predecessors – politicians and others – who put aside differences, who found compromises, who took our countries forwards together in circumstances far tougher than now. And the results for both UK and Ireland are immense. Not just a peaceful and open border but an economic partnership by which we eat I think 50 per cent of all the cheese and beef produced in Ireland, and we are talking a lot. And the very captain of the world cup winning English cricket team was born in this city. And I think that our job now is to take that relationship forward and to build on it at the UK-Ireland summit in November, I look forward to that, and in all the ways in which the UK and Ireland work together around the world with shared values and shared interests. As you rightly say Taoiseach, before November there are two political tasks that we simply have to do. We must restore the government of Northern Ireland at Stormont, and I promise to work with you on our shared objective. And we must get Brexit done because the UK must come out on October 31, or else I fear that permanent damage will be done to confidence in our democracy in the UK. And I know that this problem of Brexit was not, to be perfectly frank, a conundrum that Ireland ever wished for and I think there are three basic questions we need now to answer for the sake of our collective peace of mind. Can we ensure that we continue to have unchecked movement at the border of goods and people and indeed cattle? I think the answer is yes – and as someone who went to the border several times before the Good Friday agreement, and shuddered to see watchtowers on UK soil, I can say now that the UK will never ever institute checks at the border, and I hope our friends in the EU would say the same. Can we uphold the Belfast Good Friday agreement in all its particulars? Again I say the answer is yes, and our commitment to the peace process is unshakeable. Can we protect the economic unity of the island of Ireland and the gains that Ireland has won through its membership of the EU single market? And again I think the answer is yes – and I think we can achieve all these things while allowing the UK to withdraw whole and entire from the EU. And of course I acknowledge the complexities involved. And the symbolism and the sensitivities evoked by the very concept of a border. But strip away the politics and at the core of each problem you find practical issues that can be resolved. With sufficient energy and a spirit of compromise, and indeed even the current treaty must logically envisage that the problems can be solved, or the present protocol would never have been called a backstop. So if I have one message that I want to land with you today Leo, it is that I want to find a deal. I want to get a deal. Like you, I’ve looked carefully at no deal. I have assessed its consequences, both for our country and yours. And, yes, of course, we could do it, the UK could certainly get through it. But be in no doubt that it would be a failure of statecraft for which we would all be responsible and so, for the sake of business, and farmers, and for millions of ordinary people who are now counting on us to use our imagination and creativity to get this done, I would overwhelmingly prefer to find an agreement. Our governments have spent three years masticating this problem. I think it is time to honour the achievements of our predecessors who tackled far worse problems by cracking this one ourselves. I won’t say that we can do it all today, but I believe there is a deal to be done by Oct 18. Let’s do it together."
"Boris Johnson","Universities Minister gives speech at Universities UK conference","12 September 2019","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/universities-minister-gives-speech-at-universities-uk-conference","It’s great to be with you here today. I’d been looking forward to this date for some time - I think I put it back in my diary last December. Obviously a few things have changed since then. I’ve had an invaluable experience over the past few weeks as Health Minister and, if anything, it’s only reinforced my appreciation for this sector, as I’ve got out and about in our hospitals and seen first-hand the unbreakable link between health and higher education – be it in the workforce or new medicines and treatments. Above all, I’ve recognised the same, undeniable social value generated by both our higher education sector and our health sector – pushing the frontiers of knowledge to improve our lives and wellbeing, and training people up for high-quality, high-value careers in their local communities.   But this has always been my dream job - and I’m delighted to be back. When you’ve lost something you love doing, you come to reflect upon what you wanted to say, if you got one more chance to do so. Now that I’ve got that chance, I thought I would share with you some of my personal reflections on what I believe should be the future of Higher Education. Those of you who’ve met me already - and I can see quite a few familiar faces in the room- know that I passionately believe in the opportunities that Higher Education and attending university brings. That universities transform the lives of individuals, and the communities that they serve. I knew that long before I became Universities Minister the first time, having taught at Bristol University before I became a politician, seeing for myself first-hand the awesome power that the transfer of knowledge brings, watching my students grow in confidence, expanding their horizons and understanding, finding their place in the world. It’s one of the greatest privileges academic teaching can bring. It’s a feeling that I’m sure unites us all in this room - you certainly know it if you’ve felt it. So I start unashamedly with a principle that I will defend, and defend again: there are not too many people going to university. The 2019 version of the OECD’s Education at a Glance report launched earlier this week by the Higher Education Policy Institute confirmed just that. As Andreas Schleicher himself said, the UK economy is in fact very responsive to the skills and qualifications our citizens have, and this country will continue to see growing demand for workers with graduate level skills. We live in a modern, knowledge economy, one which requires the advanced skills that university teaches. Other countries fully recognise this. To take a different path risks eroding the progress that we have made as a nation, a nation that has travelled so far in recent decades in placing education at the forefront of its investment. Over the past year- and I can’t quite believe it hasn’t yet been a year since I was first appointed Universities Minister- I’ve visited 39 universities across the country. In fact, I think I have the highest university visit run-rate of any minister since David Willetts! And today, I’ll be visiting my 40th, Birmingham City University – an institution with the Arts and Humanities firmly at its core in the form of the Royal Birmingham Conservatoire. Since becoming Universities Minister the first time round, I’ve been keen to defend the Arts and Humanities, and shall continue in my efforts to ensure their value is enhanced and appreciated as we make our way into a new, uncertain world; a world where languages, communication and inter-cultural awareness are going to be more important than ever before. Each and every one of my university visits has only reinforced my belief in Higher Education and the value that HE expansion has contributed to society. From the Student Unions that are modern, professional organisations committed to voluntary work and advancing the causes of student mental health, to the early career researchers passionate about their work and demonstrating to me its value, to the wider investments that universities are making in the other parts of my ministerial brief, whether that is in space technology at Leicester, nuclear robotics at Manchester, or Quantum technology at Sussex. Universities are crucial to our society; as institutions, they are woven deep both into the fabric of local communities but also our national reputation. The work of the UPP Foundation Civic University Commission earlier this year has helped to tease this out and I am pleased that so many of you have committed to create Civic University Agreements going forwards, to cement your contribution to your cities and regions. I am also pleased to learn of work like the ‘21st Century Lab’ being led by the University of Lincoln, which is opening up thinking on how our higher education sector should develop as our economics, societies, nations and cultures evolve. And it is in the context of this changing world that it is worth reflecting upon your importance. I’m proud to be the Minister for a sector which boasts many of the best universities in the world – including four in the QS World top 10, and 18 in the top 100. A sector which is second in the world in attracting global talent to study here. As the Minister who published the International Education Strategy, as well as the International Research and Innovation Strategy earlier this year, I know we all can, and want, to go even further. Which is why I am delighted that the Prime Minister and the Education and Home Secretaries announced the return of the two year post-study work visa this week. And I want to pay tribute here to the work of my predecessor Jo Johnson for his efforts to make this a reality. I want to work with everyone in this room to ensure the United Kingdom continues to be an attractive place to study. As your Minister, I want you to know that I will continue to also take the approach that I have always done with the sector: to listen, to learn, and to work together to help co-create the solutions to the challenges that we face. And of course, I recognise that the sector does indeed face challenges. But I’ve always taken the approach that if we work hand in hand, as critical partners and friends, we possess the will and the ability to meet them. And we have in this government and the Prime Minister someone who is willing to create the environment to enable our universities to succeed for the future. I’ve only been gone from this role less than fifty days, but already we have had key announcements on expanding the government guarantee to fund European Research Council grants, and a crucial restatement of our ambition to raise R&D spending to 2.4% of GDP by 2027. This restatement matters, and it will shape our future as a nation. With the support and advice of UKRI and many others, we are working hard on the roadmap for achieving this target. After outlining my vision in a series of speeches before the summer, I am keenly looking forward to getting this detailed roadmap published this autumn. Let me just offer one early reflection, though. If we want to turn the UK into scientific superpower and achieve our ambition to reach 2.4%, then we need to ramp up capacity and capability in our universities. And as you know, one of my final acts as science minister last time around was to announce a significant real-terms increase to QR funding – the largest increase in a decade. Connected to this, I am determined to see renewed focus given to basic research. Funding for blue-skies, curiosity-driven research has been dwindling as a proportion of our overall spend. This is a problem. As part of our 2.4% package I want to see further increases to QR and a significant uplift to response-mode research council funding. Don’t get me wrong. It is of course essential that we should continue to drive application and impact from our research investments – turning great ideas into real benefits for the UK in the form of better jobs, improved products and services, and real action on issues such as climate change. Let me reassure you that I remain firmly committed to the impact agenda and to knowledge exchange, including support via HEIF and implementation of the Knowledge Exchange Framework. But if we want to succeed in the long term, the really long term, then we need to ensure we are doing everything we can to entice and empower our research community to undertake the most ground-breaking, cutting edge work, raising the UK’s international reputation even higher. That’s why as Science, Research and Innovation Minister, I will continue to make the case, time and time again, for not just the importance of raising public funding for research, but as the Minister who published the International Research and Innovation Strategy, and commissioned Sir Adrian Smith to undertake a review of how we can improve and increase our international science and research partnerships, that we seek to transform our research agenda, to become the partner country of choice, and to invest in new models of research funding that will catalyse this. And as we approach leaving the European Union, I will continue to make the case loud and clear, that while we are leaving the EU, we are not leaving our European friends and research partners behind. We want to get a deal with the EU which will protect our continuation in Horizon 2020, and will continue our participation in Erasmus+. We will be fully exploring the option of participating in the next Erasmus programme, whilst also developing potential alternatives which are ambitious and truly global. We will protect our participation in Erasmus+ and will be working hard to secure full association with Horizon Europe - I personally will be doing everything in my power to achieve this. In order to manage the transition through Brexit, I want to reassure the sector that EU nationals who start a higher education course in England in the 2020/21 academic year or before will continue to be eligible for ‘home fee’ status and student finance support on a similar basis to domestic students for the full duration of their course. And as we scale up our research efforts, we must make sure that every single one of our brilliant scientists and researchers is able to work in a vibrant and diverse research environment – underpinned by an institutional culture of trust, support and integrity. I therefore want to give my strong backing to the work that Julia Buckingham has led to review and update the Concordat to Support the Career Development of Researchers. I encourage everyone in this room to now do their part to bring it to life. I also want us to learn lessons from what works in other sectors, such as the NHS, that are successfully tackling bullying and harassment. One of the lessons I will take away from my ‘placement’, as it were, within the NHS, relates to my work on the NHS People Plan. For if we are to ensure organisations and institutions are to be sustainable for the future, then we need to invest in people, at every stage of their lives. Creating not only new jobs, and indeed recognising that these jobs may need to adapt for the future, but building careers. As institutions that are leading the world in creating ideas, talent and social value, universities should aspire to be beacons of virtue and lead by example. We need to be looking closely not only at how we train, but also how we retain the academics of the future; so a focus on the working conditions of early career research, building a pipeline of talent, is absolutely vital. But a well-functioning university culture needs sustainable institutions. And when it comes to ensuring that we have a sustainable university landscape, while it is absolutely right that we focus on post-18 education for all, making investment in Further Education that is desperately needed, we must not lose sight of what we have in the HE sector. We cannot afford as a society to pit FE against HE: as I have argued elsewhere, both are crucial to a unity of purpose in our post-18 landscape that needs to be more flexible, more portable, and one that meets the needs of the learner, not simply those of the provider. And at the same time, ensuring that access and participation remains at the heart of that vision also. How we achieve this must be central to not just my mission as Universities Minister, but all of our missions. Universities have made vast improvements since 2010, but there is, I believe, much more we can do together. Access and Participation plans are just the start. Those of you who have read my previous speeches will know that I believe that we can go further focusing not just on the importance of increasing access, but realising that the journey does not end once students pass through the university door. Understanding that student transition, experience and progress, through to a successful degree outcome are all equally important and we can and must do more to deliver for disadvantaged students throughout their university career. In my last speech as Universities Minister in July, I touched upon where I believe the sector and government will need to focus its attention for the future. Effective data will be vital if we are to understand how to drive performance, and I remain determined to ensure that universities have the effective tools to analyse and drive their civic missions to improve access for WP categories. Universities have never been better placed to help be the agents of change, unlocking the opportunities that can transform disadvantaged communities in their regions. I know from my experience that you too are all passionate about making further progress. What progress will look like for the future is a debate which I wish to engage the sector on. Already we have the review of admissions by the OfS and UUK, and I believe that we can continue to focus on the best practice that should exist on that critical, defining, relationship between secondary and tertiary education. But I also believe that when it comes to admissions, in turn we will need to continue to be more radical still, as I spoke in my Birkbeck lecture in July, recognising that contextual offers will take on an increasing importance if we are to deliver a truly level playing field that provides opportunity from some of the most disadvantaged in society. The truth is, you know as well as I do, that our universities are remarkable institutions of knowledge; complex and intricate organisations, the product of decades of dedication from individuals who have built them to become the success story they are today. Reform and change too, while vital if we are to meet the future challenges of the twenty first century, must recognise this, alongside ensuring the principle of autonomy, enshrined in law, is recognised and respected. It is my role as your minister, to both be challenged by yourselves, but also to challenge, to act as a critical friend, but also as your champion and ambassador, both at home and abroad. I look forward to working with you all to secure a bright, truly international future for our universities in the years to come. Thank you."
"Boris Johnson","RESI Convention 2019","12 September 2019","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/resi-convention-2019","Well hello and it really is a pleasure to be here in the busiest week in politics, well that is since the last week in politics! And it’s wonderful to be here in Newport. Though I have to say I did ask as it’s my very first speech as Housing Minister and it’s a devolved matter, why am I in Wales? And then when I got here and saw how magnificent the place was, I could see why you keep coming back here so I am delighted to be here with you today. And, I am also the first female Housing Minister in a decade. Now you don’t come into politics as a woman to do ‘housework’, but when the Prime Minister asks you to do so on behalf of your country you make an exception! And maybe, just maybe Boris thought the ask was so big, building 300,000 homes each year by the mid-2020s, only a woman could get that much ‘housework’ done! Whilst I might be the first woman in a decade to do this job, you all know there has been 9 housing ministers in 9 years, so I want to say, that although we have been many in number, our collective commitment to deliver the homes this country needs has been constant and unwavering. That working with yourselves, working with the industry, we have together delivered some significant achievements. We published the new National Planning Policy Framework scheme ironing out the planning process to help us deliver the houses we need. Our work on planning reform continues, as we focus on delivering an Accelerated Planning Green Paper. We’ve invested £9 billion in the Affordable Homes Programme and committed a further £2 billion in long-term partnerships that gives Housing Associations the certainty through funding up to 2029, nearly 10 years from now. And we have all focused on ensuring that our flagship Help to Buy programme has driven the supply in new homes and vitally, have helped a new generation of people onto the property ladder. Progress together has been significant since 2010, 1.3 million more homes have been delivered. 430,000 affordable homes. With 222,000 additional homes built in the last year alone. Government is backing the industry with real investment and with interventions. And that is to make the dream of home ownership a reality. A dream that the vast majority of the public still have and continue to have. And why is that? It’s about having a stake in society, it’s about having security, it is about aspiration, it is actually about freedom. It’s about financial security, and it’s about safety for you and your family and it provides people with a real stake in their community. And whether you own your home or not, we all need a roof over our head. I can say that because I’ve had many homes in my life, many experiences in my life. I’ve been in a Barnardo’s home, I’ve been in my grandparents’ home, I’ve been in a council home, my first family owned home and now my own home. Every single one holds an exceptional and significant experience for me. So, providing these homes are essential; to provide homes for all people, from all walks of life, for the need they have at that moment in time. In fact, it is a scandal, possibly the greatest scandal over the last 30 years that we’ve had a shortage in houses. And that has led, as we know, to a rise in renting and costs, and to a fall in home ownership which has destroyed the aspiration of a generation of working people. We need to put that right. And this government, with your help will put that right. Since the mid-1990s, house prices have risen to 8 times, 10 times, 12 times, in some of the most expensive parts of this country 44 times the actual income of someone, that cannot be right. Successive Conservative governments have sought to put a lid on that escalation, helping working people get on the housing ladder so they don’t have to dip into the bank of mum and dad. It still isn’t enough, but we have cut stamp duty for 95% of first-time buyers and abolished it altogether for 80% of them. We’ve introduced Help to Buy, loan and ISA, helping more than half a million have the security of home ownership. And we’ve continued the hugely successful Right to Buy which has helped generations after generations onto the housing ladder. But there is a limit to what government can do, for example, Help to Buy is precisely that. It is helping people to buy, it is not helping somebody to make a profit, it is not helping to increase the prices of property. It is about helping people to buy. So this government will be vigilant about what is working, keeping an eye on our goal. That is a shared goal, helping people into a home and into home ownership. Extending ownership schemes and building the homes the country needs. And, we’re doing that straight away, we’ve looked at ownership models, so making Shared Ownership more accessible for working families. We’ve started that already so buyers can have a staircase of 1% increases rather than 10% leaps. We’re going to look to expand Shared Ownership, supporting it in different ways, taking out what we hear to be the difficulties of it, the expense of it. It shouldn’t be unfair for those trying to get onto the housing market. And Rent to Buy, so people can rent knowing that they are going to buy, knowing that they’ve got a bit of breathing space, maybe it’s in 5 years, maybe it’s in 10 years, but they will get to own that property - so they can plan, knowing they have the certainty of getting a deposit and getting that house. And Right to Build, so many places around the world have far more people building their own homes, so we’re going to be there, whether its support for Right to Buy or Right to Build. And also supporting communities, for Communities to Build. Because there are so many houses to build - we need to open up all of those opportunities. Too many people feel that vital link between hard-work and owning their own home is broken. And when that link is severed, social mobility and opportunity falls away. For so many people in our public sector, like our nurses and our teachers, like our police, owning their own home feels like the dream that has been taken away from them. This is not right, they are the backbone of our country. They deserve a home of their own and they are looking to us to see what we can do. They are looking to us to fix it like we look to them to teach our kids like we look to them when we need healthcare, to look after us. They’re looking to us now to return that favour and look after them. So, that’s 300,000 more homes a year to build. Each and every year. Now we’re getting closer to that target – we’re building more, more than before. In fact last year we built more homes than in every year bar one in the last 31 years. In Greater Manchester, the number of extra homes built is rising by more than 12%. In Birmingham, it’s rising by 80%. Only in London, [political content removed], have the number of new homes fallen. While the trend is heading upwards, I’ve found there’s still serious barriers stopping that progress unnecessarily, and we need to understand what those barriers are, understand what is getting in our way so we can remove them. We also need to focus on Brownfield sites – what are we doing there? Are we doing enough there? Are we building enough homes there? Regeneration must be something we should be most proud of, turning round, I call it, unloved land. And I know regeneration is a tough thing to do, I know that, that’s what my family’s business is in – demolition, excavation, regeneration, so we know that, and that is why government has put in billions of pounds in support to help with regeneration on Brownfield sites and that is what we must do. Because greenfield land, greenfield sites, should not be what we turn to, not what we look at first. Every blade of grass must be looked at before it is changed – and it is only in the most exceptional circumstances we turn there and I can announce today councils will receive a share of nearly £2 million to crackdown on illegal development, including in the green belt. I’ll be putting money there, to help with enforcement officers, new technology and legal costs. And alongside that, there will be a cash boost, from our department too, we are teaming up with the Royal Town Planning Institute to overhaul the National Enforcement Handbook. These are the things that we are offering to do, and can do. And I want to look at those 300,000 new homes, in a different way now, because I see that as enormous, absolutely enormous. I just think of the opportunities, enormous opportunities, exciting prospects and I’m talking in design and type. I’m talking in diversity of homes. I’m talking in technology of the home. I’m talking environmentally of the home - carbon zero homes. I’m taking creativity, in the style of the home, the type of living, reflecting the needs of people, whichever part of the housing ladder, young single people, divorcees, elderly, disabled people, families – all kinds of partnerships. Each one of these needs a different type of home. Are we really reflecting those different types of homes and needs? I speak to young people across the country and they say these homes don’t really reflect what we’d like to see. Some want a family home, some want a bigger home, some want what they see as more like a future community - living in an exceptional space, maybe with a shared gym, maybe with a shared space downstairs, and within it an apartment as their own home, these would be much cheaper in price, a smaller apartment that they could own. Surely between us, looking across what’s happening in the world, we can get the homes that different generations want. And what about the jobs and the careers to build all these homes, we need to think about that. We need to be opening up this house building to SME’s, bringing them onboard, bringing it to communities, bringing it to the self-build and bringing in modern methods of construction. We are now at a transformational turning point where we can make homes by manufacturing them at a very high specification. Cars, over the years, have gone smarter, faster, sleeker, leaner. Phones are no longer about talking to one another, they are computers in your pocket, connecting you with the world. TV’s are bigger, are flatter, are high definition. Our houses have to be exactly the same, replicate this change, so we can build them faster, sleeker, environmentally friendlier, cheaper and what people want. Because that is what it’s about, it is about the customer. What do they want? And that is what we’ve got to be on the side of the person who needs that home, who knows they are putting pretty much all the money they earn into that home, and so it has to be what they want, and not what they are given and just have to accept! And, we are going to strengthen up home owner’s rights as well, as we consult on a future home owners Ombudsman. Because now, (as we leave the E.U. and set about building 300,000 homes a year) we could become global leaders in the world of house building, of high end engineering, manufacturing, 3D specification, architecture and traditional build too. And with that, I see clusters of excellence across the country, of where modular building is being developed - in the North East, Yorkshire, the North West, - I see in my mind’s eye, just like you see homes in your mind’s eye, I see, a Centre of Construction Excellence being established in the North of the country, combining all these things, so we can have a newly found industry. You’re not just living in a home, you can prosper from having a job in creating those homes, when we are building at such a significant scale and pace, the career opportunities are huge. And we can set new housing standards for the rest of the world. You talked about Brexit before because yes, we are moving into a world post the EU. With the government’s help we are getting ready for Brexit, helping UK businesses get geared up for the challenges and opportunities ahead. We will be carrying over EU product requirements as valid for sale, to ensure smooth transition for the construction industry. And we’re making sure we’ve got the skills here in the UK to deliver what we need for that next generation of homes, through our technical hubs, through our, as I see it, Centre of Excellence, which will be industry led, which can deliver training, right up to high end degree apprenticeships. So we will be bold, we will be visionary, we will be setting the world alight as we go forward with what we can do. I remember somebody said to me, which made such a huge impact on me as a child, you know everything you see, was created within someone’s mind, it never existed until somebody thought of it and then thought of a way to do it. You are those people. You are those architects, those visionaries, who set the scene. Together we will do it. We will do it together, and please know, the government will support you. We have supported you. Together we have to tackle this Great British housing building problem. Thank you."
"Boris Johnson","An Electric Revolution in the skies","19 September 2019","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/an-electric-revolution-in-the-skies","Good afternoon everyone, it’s fantastic to be at Cranfield. A place that has played an integral role in the story of flight in this country. So, this is a very apt location for one of my first aviation speeches as Transport Secretary – especially as a pilot who chaired Parliament’s All Party Group on Aviation. Now just as Cranfield has shaped UK aviation past and present, this place will play a major part in its future too. And today I want to talk about that future, both its challenges and the opportunities – and how we will rise to meet both. We are today called to meet a challenge, a priority so pressing that everything we do at the Department for Transport, and across government, must have regard to reducing CO2 emissions. Some estimates suggest that aviation makes up 12% of average household emissions. And forecasts suggest that with within 3 decades that figure could grow to over a quarter. With UK annual passenger traffic to soar from 292 million to 435 million by 2050. A prospect both welcome for families and businesses but that requires action on emissions for the sake of our children and our fragile environment. Now with this critical mission, comes a once in a generation opportunity. British industry, and especially British aviation, can lead the world in the technological revolution we need. We have done this before. From the pioneering work of Sir Frank Whittle on the jet engine, to the development of Concorde and the Harrier – a project in which your forebears at Cranfield were intricately involved. We led the world in aviation innovation. In my own constituency the world’s first jet airliner was developed. But we can leave nothing to chance in this great national endeavour. I know that there’s so much work already taking place. The fuel efficiency of aircraft is steadily improving. You’re investing in the development of sustainable, low carbon fuels, and you are even looking at the possibility of moving away from such fuels altogether. While the government is doing its part, and leading on the global stage, we recently became the first major economy to make a legal commitment to net zero carbon emissions by 2050. We’ve announced ambitious plans for the design and manufacture of zero emission vehicles - I drive one myself. And within aviation - where I don’t yet, but I am proud that the UK has played a major role in creating the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation, the first truly global scheme to address CO2 emissions in any single sector. And we’ll shortly consult on how we can ensure that aviation fully contributes to the UK reaching its net zero target by 2050. But we need to keep up the momentum. Today I’ve glimpsed the future with technologies being developed by some of you in this room, allowing the sector to thrive sustainably in the 21st century. From a digital air traffic control tower to the Volante Vision. The possibilities are boundless - take electric planes. As someone who recently became the owner of that electric car, I’ve seen how battery power allows us to reduce emissions from road vehicles, but they also offer incredible economic potential for manufacturers and innovators. So, I want to create an electric revolution not just on the UK’s roads, but also in our skies. The UK led the world as a pioneer of international commercial flight in the 20th century, and I want this country to become a hotbed for the design, manufacture and use of electric aircraft in the 21st, seizing a share of a market that could be worth £4 trillion globally by 2050, and harnessing immense benefits of this transition: lower emissions greater efficiency and the power to transform mobility in towns and cities I know that Cranfield and Loganair are developing hybrid electric aircraft for commercial passenger flights, through the Fresson Project, to transport people in the Orkney Islands. And the CAA is working with pioneering firms, such as air taxi company Volocopter, and then there’s the brilliant collaborative work taking place on the Airbus and Rolls-Royce E-Fan X Project. But while I’m excited at the possibilities, I’m also a pragmatist. We need the right infrastructure, the right batteries and the right research, to make the electrification of flights take off. That’s why I was delighted that the Prime Minister recently announced a £300 million joint investment, from government and industry through the Future Flight Challenge. Money that will fund electric plane innovation, and research into other forms of aviation technology, including flying taxis and freight carrying drones. This is on top of the nearly £2 billion we are ploughing into aviation research and technology, through the Aerospace Technology Institute Programme. Only yesterday, through that programme, the government awarded £2.7 million to a start-up company ZeroAvia, to build a hydrogen fuel cell propulsion system that will aid the development of zero emission aviation technology in this country. And work is taking place in the sector more broadly, take for instance, the £65 million Digital Aviation Research and Technology Centre being built here. But another key part of our success will depend on ensuring the next generation is ready to take up the mantle. Everyone, from FTSE 100 companies to tiny flying schools, will have a part in securing our future global leadership. And I want to directly address General Aviation. It’s a sector that sparks imaginations, provides opportunity and incubates the aviation workforce of tomorrow. Plenty of air cadets have been inspired to serve in the RAF after a glider flight at their local airfield. Some of the best aviation engineers started out as flying school apprentices. While countless commercial pilots obtained their licence at their local airfield. So, it’s vital that we protect our network of airfields where so many aviation careers first take flight. That’s why I’m delighted to appoint today Phil Dunnington as our General Aviation Advocate. Phil was the first balloon pilot to cross the North West Arctic Passage and is a long standing champion of GA.I know he will do a great job at representing the industry and raising its profile. Because General Aviation will have a big part in solving some of the most pressing challenges facing the sector. We must also recruit thousands more engineers, technicians and pilots, and ensure we draw on all our country’s talents. In this country – the birthplace of Amy Johnson who flew solo from England to Australia in 1930 – just 6 in every 100 pilots are women. While people from ethnic minorities are remain massively underrepresented. I think general aviation could help address those issues. By enabling young people of all backgrounds to gain a deeper understanding of what a career in flight might entail, whether that’s by taking a trial flight in a light aircraft or talking to an aviator. But as well as real, tangible experience - we also need to provide positive role models. There’s a saying: ‘you can’t be it, if you can’t see it.’ That’s why today I’m delighted to appoint 6 Aviation Ambassadors to inspire the next generation, break down any barriers, and any lingering glass ceilings. They are: Kirsty Murphy, a member of aerobatics display team, The Blades and the first woman to join the Red Arrows Patricia Mawuli Porter and Jonathan Porter who have overcome huge obstacles to pioneer flight training in Ghana for people from all backgrounds – and now here in the UK Kate McWilliams, who became the world’s youngest female commercial airline captain at the age of 26 Arthur Williams, a former Royal Marine, who trained to become an airline pilot after being paralysed in a car accident Jo Salter, the RAF’s first female fast jet pilot Together, with all of us, they will encourage the next generation of pilots, broaden access and drive social mobility throughout the sector. So a big thank you to you all and of course also to Phil for your upcoming time, energy and expertise. These appointments are a sign of this government’s focus on ensuring that the aviation industry of tomorrow, is the very best it can be. I want to turn briefly to our evolving role in the world. Earlier this month I confirmed measures to ensure flights between the UK and EU will continue to October next year - whether we leave with a deal or not. I also announced that my department would extend the UK’s air traffic rights for EU airlines. I know that preparing to leave the EU has meant hard work, and the sector’s response has been tremendous. But I’d like to stress that our withdrawal from the EU means that we will continue to enjoy warm friendships with our close neighbours, and embrace the rest of the globe too. I’m reminded of the first scheduled international commercial flight between London and Paris, that took off 100 years ago last month. The flight of that little de Havilland plane was not only a feat of daring and engineering endeavour, it was also an exercise in building international partnership – paving the way to the global aviation network we know today. So now is the time to cement old partnerships and forge new ones, with aviation at the heart, demonstrating we are truly Global Britain. So finally, I’d like to thank you all for coming today. This government’s commitment to developing a truly low carbon economy has profound implications for every mode of transport. And certainly, as I said at the start, the challenges facing aviation are considerable, but as today has so clearly highlighted this is also a moment of opportunity. Opportunities for the aviation industry to grow long into the 21st century. Opportunities for this country to become a global trailblazer for a new generation of aviation technology. And opportunities for us all to build a cleaner, greener, better connected world. Thank you and I look forward to working with all of you in the months ahead."
"Boris Johnson","Global Britain is leading the world as a force for good: article by Dominic Raab","22 September 2019","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/global-britain-is-leading-the-world-as-a-force-for-good-article-by-dominic-raab","This week, I will join the Prime Minister in New York, where he is leading the UK delegation to the United Nations’ annual General Assembly. As we make progress in our Brexit negotiations, we are also taking our vision of a truly Global Britain to the UN – leading by example as a force for good in the world. The Government is making progress on Brexit negotiations, with the European Commission President, Jean‑Claude Juncker, stating plainly “I think we can have a deal”. Meanwhile, Liz Truss, the Trade Secretary, has been in Tokyo, paving the way for a free-trade deal with Japan and the wider Asia‑Pacific region. We want to be good European neighbours and buccaneering global free traders. But Global Britain is about more than Brexit or even free trade, important though they are. Under Boris Johnson, we intend to reinforce Britain’s role in the world as a good global citizen – and the UN is a great place to start. Next year, we will host the UN Climate Change Summit, bringing the world together in Glasgow to demonstrate our leadership on climate change. We’ve got an impressive story to tell. After all, Britain was the first country to legislate to end our contribution to global warming, so that we leave the environment in a better state for the next generation. And our innovative approach to green technologies such as electric vehicles and renewable energy will help lead the way. We want to bring that experience to bear with our international partners – from Brazil to Indonesia – because we know this is a global challenge that demands international action. In New York, I will speak alongside human rights lawyer and UK Special Envoy, Amal Clooney, about the new Media Freedom Coalition we’ve set up with Canada. The first wave of 26 countries has signed up, committing to protecting media freedoms in their own countries, speaking out against abuses, and standing up for oppressed journalists around the world. Amal Clooney is convening a high-level panel of legal experts to advise countries on how to strengthen their legal protections for journalists. This international team will turn these lofty ideals into national laws that will protect journalists on the ground. And when journalists come under assault, we’ll be there to defend them – with a Global Media Defence Fund backed by £3 million of UK funding. Working with Unesco, the fund will train journalists, help keep them safe, and provide legal assistance in some of the most dangerous places journalists work – whether it’s reporting on the Taliban from Afghanistan or tracking cartel violence in Mexico. When we leave the EU, we will also reinforce our sanctions legislation to hold those who commit serious abuses of human rights to account – by barring them from entering the UK and freezing their assets such as bank accounts. That will provide a layer of UK accountability against those who target journalists, whistle-blowers and human rights campaigners with impunity in their own countries. As well as championing these causes, the UN General Assembly is also an opportunity for the international community to come together to defend the international rule of law, by calling on all its members to play by the rules. We will shine a spotlight on Iran’s violations of international law, including its destabilising actions in the region. And we will be condemning that country’s cruel practice of arbitrarily detaining dual nationals on spurious charges, often in appalling conditions, and in a flagrant disregard for international law. We want to be a constructive voice on Hong Kong, supporting its people’s right to peaceful protest and encouraging political dialogue on all sides – within the framework of ‘one country, two systems’ that China has consistently advocated since 1984. When we leave the EU, there will be enormous opportunities across the world. And Britain will be a force for good. We will trade more liberally, including with the poorest countries held back by Western protectionism. We will lead on climate change. We will be a champion of the basic freedoms enshrined in the UN Charter, and a doughty defender of the rules-based international system – the world’s best bet when it comes to tackling the challenges we all share.

"Boris Johnson","Speech by Alok Sharma at UNGA climate resilience and adaptation event","22 September 2019","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/speech-by-alok-sharma-at-unga-climate-resilience-and-adaptation-event","Thank you Andrew. Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, of course, I’m absolutely delighted to introduce the work of our coalition, alongside my excellent co-lead, Her Excellency Minister Fouad. I’m really grateful for the joint working Andrew, as you’ve set out - obviously on the UK side - but also particularly with our friends in Egypt and Minister, for your personal commitment to this – I think that has really helped to drive this agenda forward. I would also like to extend my thanks to my esteemed colleagues from Bangladesh, from the Netherlands, from Malawi and of course, St Lucia for their contributions. When talking about the climate it is easy to feel overwhelmed by the sheer scale of the challenge we face: With almost a million plant and animal species at risk of extinction. And with floods, droughts and storms - each one pushing yet more people into poverty. We must take this threat seriously. In his remarks, Achim Steiner talked about referencing events in the Bahamas, well Hurricane Dorian is an incredibly sad and yet timely reminder of the urgency that we need in facing this particular threat. First responders to Dorian described the scenes on the ground as ‘apocalyptic.’ Roofs ripped from buildings. Homes under water. Families left devastated by the loss of their loved ones. And it’s not as if we haven’t been warned before about this. 30 years ago, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher warned about the “insidious danger” of man-made climate change. We cannot afford to wait. The UK is proudly leading the way: We were the first major economy in the world to enshrine our commitment to net zero emissions by 2050 into law, into legislation in the UK. We are deeply honoured to have been nominated, in partnership with our friends in Italy, for the COP 26 presidency next year. And of course we are delighted to be co-leading on adaptation and resilience at the Climate Action Summit. My friend, Minister Fouad has already outlined the package that we plan to put forward. We are rallying the international community, our Call to Action has, as she’s already said, got over 100 signatories. The United Kingdom is committing £236 million towards these efforts, and the package will have three priorities: Firstly, it’s about protecting our natural environment. Whilst feeding nine billion people, we need a rural transition towards sustainable land use to rise to the challenge, we will need the best experience from around the world to come together. And while we do this, we need to support those on the front line. Smallholder farmers across the developing world are among the most vulnerable. We will support them by providing £61 million to develop crops that are drought, flood and disease resistant. This will support 100 million farmers and lift 30 million people out of poverty. Secondly, it’s about protecting the most vulnerable people in our society from natural disasters. For every $100 invested in a humanitarian response, we only invest $4 in disaster risk reduction. This has to change. Tomorrow, we will launch a new Partnership that will make 1 billion people safer from extreme weather and natural disasters by 2025. By bringing the latest technology together with humanitarian and climate finance, we can prepare for disasters before they strike. The UK will invest £85 million towards this effort. But we’ll still need to respond to the effects of when disasters occur. So we will also invest £90 million to help people respond to emergencies after they have struck. And finally, it’s about building the resilience of our economies. As we have seen in the United Kingdom, economic growth does not need to come at the expense of our natural environment. Developing countries need infrastructure to grow their way out of poverty. Infrastructure that is resilient in the face of a changing climate. That is why we are working with key private sector partners to launch a Coalition for Climate Resilient Investments. To make infrastructure fit for the future. In closing, I would just say that our commitment to vulnerable countries is clear. We will support through initiatives like the Least Developed Countries Vision for a Resilient Future, and the African Adaptation Initiative. My Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, announced last month that the United Kingdom will double our contribution to the Green Climate Fund, which again underlines our commitment. In closing, I would just add, that it is easy to talk about the scale of the threat. It is of course much, much harder to put these words into action. But together, we can, and will, rise to the challenge. Thank you."
"Boris Johnson","PM speech at Hudson Yards business event: 24 September 2019","24 September 2019","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-speech-at-hudson-yards-business-event-24-september-2019","Thank you very much for that welcome and I’m very, very proud to be standing here in front of this incredible creation which of course symbolises my message to you this morning. Because it is designed by the same man who sculpted the beautiful domes of the London Routemaster bus. I’m proud also to be the first Prime Minister of the UK to be born in New York – a very, very, very expensive decision that that turned out to be. And it’s a very exciting time in our country, we’re getting on with delivering Brexit and I just want to say a word or two about that. Because there’s been a court case in our country this morning of which I – it would be remiss or wrong of me not to address that directly and we’ve got our friends from the UK media here as well - and I just want to say to everybody watching back home for the avoidance of doubt, I have the highest respect of course for our judiciary and the independence of our courts But I must say, I strongly disagree with this judgement, and we in the UK will not be deterred from getting on and delivering on the will of the people to come out of the EU on October 31st. Because we were mandated to do. And we will simultaneously refuse to be deterred from delivering on what I think you will all expect to be an exciting dynamic, domestic agenda intended to make our country even more attractive to live in and to invest in. So we are pushing on with infrastructure, investing in police, investment in our NHS and to do that we will need a Queen’s speech to set out what we are going to do. And I think frankly, that is what the people in my country of the UK want to see. They want to see us delivering on getting on with a strong domestic agenda and believe you me, they want to see Brexit delivered by October 31st. Anyway that’s what you need to know about what’s happening in the court today. But I can tell you that under any circumstances, court judgements or otherwise my heart lifts when I come to New York. There’s something amazing, the snap, fizz, the energy in this city. I love the blue sky, against the sky scrapers, the weird strange Martian water towers on the tops of the buildings. It’s the things that in New York you never find anywhere else. But there are many ways in which New York and London are not just similar but actually united. And it isn’t just that we share a language – kind of. We have a basic idea of freedom, the idea that common to our democracies. That if you obey the law and you do no harm to others then you can come and live your life as you please. Without being judged or censured. And it is the excitement of that freedom that brings people of talent to New York as it brings people to London. And so you get this cyclotron effect the flash of inspiration that leads to innovation and to prosperity and growth. And very often it will be a synthesis between American and British ideas. We invented for instance the underground train. You invented the safety brake elevator - take them together and you’ve got the recipe for a metropolis. And you can see the same fusion today across our cities in every sphere from tech to the arts to newspapers. You know the figures, actually they’re going up I think around 1.2 million US people employed by UK companies and a million or more in the UK, Trade now worth 200 billion a year, going up the whole time. Colossal investment. But to cut to the chase, we now want to do so much more – because our country is going up. And on October 31 the UK intends to be more global, more outward-looking and more committed to the rest of the world than ever before. And we are going to take advantage of all the freedoms that Brexit can give. Whether that is new tax allowances for investment. Or speeding up public procurement contracts. Or creating new free ports and enterprise zones. Or devising better regulation for sectors in which the UK leads the world – whether that’s bioscience or financial services or whatever. More competitive tax rates and the best skilled workforce in the hemisphere. And so I say to everybody who’s done me the honour of coming this morning to this breakfast, we will roll out the red carpet for our American friends. And we are increasing the number of visas for scientists. We are ensuring that your brilliant students can stay on for two years so as to get real value from their studies. And so that our economy in the UK benefits from their expertise. We are even ensuring that US visitors are able to use the electronic e-passport system at Heathrow. And yes - we want to do the much wanted free trade deal. I’m not saying it’s going to be easy because there will be things that we do not want our NHS to be on the table, and there will be differences. And I am glad that President Trump has set up the special relationship economic working group. Because it is absolutely absurd that there should be tariffs on Californian wine. Or that British shoppers should be pay over the odds for Florida orange juice. But it is also absurd and indefensible that the population of America to the best of my knowledge has gone for decades without eating a morsel of British lamb, or beef. Let alone haggis. And I have discovered that anyone wanting to sell socks to the United States. I think they at least face a tariff of up to 19 per cent. I was told that some kinds have been taken to a laboratory and set fire to twice. There are only certain ports in the United States that are licenced to receive British cauliflower. And the US military are banned from buying British tape measures as though there was still some kind of general prejudice still against British rulers. So I ask you, my friends, is this really necessary? Let us work together to break down these barriers that have been devised by bureaucrats. Because all the evidence of the last two centuries is that free trade is the fastest and most effective way to increase the prosperity of our people. This year our country the UK takes a giant step out into the world. In keeping with our traditions but also with our new ambitions. To build on our friendships and relationships with our friends in Europe, the US and Canada. We do it with confidence to make Britain the best place in the world to start, to build and to run a business. The place you will want to be. The place you will want your business to be. And that’s why I say to everyone here – come and join us. Thank you very much."
"Boris Johnson","PM speech to the UN General Assembly: 24 September 2019","24 September 2019","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-speech-to-the-un-general-assembly-24-september-2019","Mr President, Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, faithful late night audience. It is customary for the British Prime Minister to come to this United Nations and pledge to advance our values and defend our rules, the rules of a peaceful world. From protecting freedom of navigation in the Gulf To persevering in the vital task of achieving a two-state solution to the conflict in the Middle East. And of course I am proud to do all of these things. But no-one can ignore a gathering force that is reshaping the future of every member of this Assembly. There has been nothing like it in history When I think of the great scientific revolutions of the past - print, the steam engine, aviation, the atomic age - I think of new tools that we acquired but over which we - the human race - had the advantage, Which we controlled. That is not necessarily the case in the digital age. You may keep secrets from your friends, from your parents, your children, your doctor – even your personal trainer – but it takes real effort to conceal your thoughts from Google. And if that is true today, in future there may be nowhere to hide. Smart cities will pullulate with sensors, all joined together by the “internet of things”, bollards communing invisibly with lamp posts So there is always a parking space for your electric car, so that no bin goes unemptied, no street unswept, and the urban environment is as antiseptic as a Zurich pharmacy. But this technology could also be used to keep every citizen under round-the-clock surveillance. A future Alexa will pretend to take orders. But this Alexa will be watching you, Clucking her tongue and stamping her foot In the future, voice connectivity will be in every room and almost every object: your mattress will monitor your nightmares; your fridge will beep for more cheese, your front door will sweep wide the moment you approach, like some silent butler; your smart meter will go hustling - if its accord - for the cheapest electricity. And every one of them minutely transcribing your every habit in tiny electronic shorthand, Stored not in their chips or their innards - nowhere you can find it, But in some great cloud of data that lours ever more oppressively over the human race A giant dark thundercloud waiting to burst And we have no control over how or when the precipitation will take place And every day that we tap on our phones or work on our ipads - as I see some of you doing now - We not only leave our indelible spoor in the ether But we are ourselves becoming a resource Click by click, tap by tap. Just as the carboniferous period created the indescribable wealth - leaf by decaying leaf - of hydrocarbons. Data is the crude oil of the modern economy And we are now in an environment where We don’t know who should own these new oil fields We don’t always know who should have the rights or the title to these gushers of cash And we don’t know who decides how to use that data Can these algorithms be trusted with our lives and hopes? Should the machines - and only the machines - decide whether or not we are eligible for a mortgage or insurance Or what surgery or medicines we should receive? Are we doomed to a cold and heartless future in which computer says yes - or computer says no With the grim finality of an emperor in the arena? How do you plead with an algorithm? How do you get it to see the extenuating circumstances And how do we know that the machines have not been insidiously programmed to fool us or even to cheat us? We already use all kinds of messaging services that offer instant communication at minimal cost. The same programmes, platforms, could also be designed for real-time censorship of every conversation, with offending words automatically deleted, indeed in some countries this happens today. Digital authoritarianism is not, alas, the stuff of dystopian fantasy but of an emerging reality. The reason I am giving this speech today is that the UK is one of the world’s tech leaders - and I believe governments have been simply caught unawares by the unintended consequences of the internet; A scientific breakthrough more far-reaching in its everyday psychological impact than any other invention since Gutenberg And when you consider how long it took for books to come into widespread circulation The arrival of the internet is far bigger than print It is bigger than the atomic age - But it is like nuclear power in that it is capable of both good and harm - but of course it is not alone As new technologies seem to race towards us from the far horizon We strain our eyes as they come, to make out whether they are for good or bad - friends or foes? AI - what will it mean? Helpful robots washing and caring for an ageing population? or pink eyed terminators sent back from the future to cull the human race? What will synthetic biology stand for - restoring our livers and our eyes with miracle regeneration of the tissues, like some fantastic hangover cure? Or will it bring terrifying limbless chickens to our tables. Will nanotechnology help us to beat disease, or will it leave tiny robots to replicate in the crevices of our cells? It is a trope as old as literature that any scientific advance is punished by the Gods When Prometheus brought fire to mankind In a tube of fennel, as you may remember, that Zeus punished him by chaining him to a tartarean crag while his liver was pecked out by an eagle And every time his liver regrew the eagle came back and pecked it again And this went on for ever - a bit like the experience of Brexit in the UK, if some of our parliamentarians had their way. In fact it was standard poetic practice to curse the protos heuretes - the person responsible for any scientific or technical breakthrough If only they had never invented the ship, then Jason would never have sailed to Colchis and all sorts of disasters would never have happened And it is a deep human instinct to be wary of any kind of technical progress In 1829 they thought the human frame would not withstand the speeds attained by Stephenson’s rocket And there are today people today who are actually still anti-science. A whole movement called the anti-Vaxxers, who refuse to acknowledge the evidence that vaccinations have eradicated smallpox And who by their prejudices are actually endangering the very children they want to protect And I totally reject this anti-scientific pessimism. I am profoundly optimistic about the ability of new technology to serve as a liberator and remake the world wondrously and benignly, indeed in countless respects technology is already doing just that. Today, nanotechnology - as I mentioned earlier - is revolutionising medicine by designing robots a fraction of the size of a red blood cell, capable of swimming through our bodies, dispensing medicine and attacking malignant cells like some Star Wars armada Neural interface technology is producing a new generation of cochlear implants, allowing the gift of hearing to people who would not otherwise be able to hear the voices of their children. A London technology company has worked out how to help the blind to navigate more freely with nothing more than an app on their smartphones - New technologies, produced in Britain, helping the deaf to hear and the blind to see. And we used to think that printing was something you did to run off a boarding card Now a British company has used 3D printing to make an engine capable of blasting a rocket into space. In African countries, millions of people without bank accounts can now transfer money using a simple app; they can buy solar energy and leap in one transaction from no electricity to green power. And new advances are making renewable energy ever cheaper, aiding our common struggle against climate change. Our understanding of the natural world is being transformed by genome sequencing. The discovery of the very essence of life itself The secret genetic code that animates the spirit of every living being. And allows medical breakthroughs the like of which we have never known. Treatments tailored to the precise genetic makeup of the individual. So far, we have discovered the secrets of less than 0.3 percent of complex life on the planet, Think what we will achieve when – and it is a matter of when – we understand 1 or 2 percent, let alone 5 or 10 percent. But how we design the emerging technologies behind these breakthroughs – and what values inform their design –will shape the future of humanity. That is my point to you tonight my friends, my Excellencies - At stake is whether we bequeath an Orwellian world, designed for censorship, repression and control, or a world of emancipation, debate and learning, where technology threatens famine and disease, but not our freedoms. Seven decades ago, this General Assembly adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights with no dissenting voices, uniting humanity for the first and perhaps only time behind one set of principles. And our declaration - our joint declaration - upholds “freedom of opinion and expression”, the “privacy” of “home or correspondence,” and the right to “seek…and impart information and ideas”. Unless we ensure that new technology reflects this spirit, I fear that our declaration will mean nothing and no longer hold. So the mission of the United Kingdom and all who share our values must be to ensure that emerging technologies are designed from the outset for freedom, openness and pluralism, with the right safeguards in place to protect our peoples. Month by month, vital decisions are being taken in academic committees, company boardrooms and industry standards groups. They are writing the rulebooks of the future, making ethical judgements, choosing what will or will not be rendered possible. Together, we need to ensure that new advances reflect our values by design. There is excellent work being done in the EU, the Commonwealth, and of course the UN, which has a vital role in ensuring that no country is excluded from the wondrous benefits of this technology, and the industrial revolution it is bringing about. But we must be still more ambitious. We need to find the right balance between freedom and control; between innovation and regulation; between private enterprise and government oversight. We must insist that the ethical judgements inherent in the design of new technology are transparent to all. And we must make our voices heard more loudly in the standards bodies that write the rules. Above all, we need to agree a common set of global principles to shape the norms and standards that will guide the development of emerging technology. So - here’s the good news - I invite you next year to a summit in London, a wonderful city, where by the way it is not raining 94 per cent of the time, and where at one stage - when I was Mayor of London - we discovered that we had more Michelin starred restaurants even than Paris. The French somehow rapidly recovered - by a process that I wasn’t quite sure was entirely fair. But we still have by far, in the UK, by far the biggest tech sector - fintech, biotech, meditech, nanotech, green tech - every kind of tech - in London - the biggest tech sector anywhere in Europe, perhaps half a million people working in tech alone. I hope you will come there, where we will seek to assemble the broadest possible coalition to take forward this vital task Building on all that the UK can contribute to this mission as a global leader in ethical and responsible technology. If we master this challenge – and I have no doubt that we can – then we will not only safeguard our ideals, we will surmount the limits that once constrained humanity and conquer the perils that once ended so many lives. Together, we can vanquish killer diseases, eliminate famine, protect the environment and transform our cities. Success will depend, now as ever, on freedom, openness and pluralism, the formula that not only emancipates the human spirit, but releases the boundless ingenuity and inventiveness of mankind, and which, above all, the United Kingdom will strive to preserve and advance. Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, thank you for your kind attention."
"Boris Johnson","Delivering Sustainable Development Goals at home and abroad matters to us all: Lord Ahmad's statement","24 September 2019","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/delivering-on-all-the-sdgs-both-home-and-abroad-matters-to-us-all","Mr President, Your Excellencies, 4 years ago, the world came together, and rightly so. We came together to agree the Sustainable Development Goals. And one of the things we all agreed upon, each and every one of us, that every child was no matter where they are in the world, has a right to an education, has a right to a fair chance and opportunity in life. Education, and in particular, girls education, is a priority. It’s a priority for the United Kingdom government and in particular, it is a priority for our Prime Minister, the Right Honourable Boris Johnson. He is passionate about girls education, and why? The reason is self-explanatory. There is good reason; by educating girls, we improve countless lives. We improve communities, we improve nations, we improve the world. From curbing infant mortality, improving child health and boosting economic growth, educating girls, we can address a whole host of the world’s economic and, yes, social challenges as well. Yet, Your Excellencies, Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, here are some facts, tragic facts: there are about 131 million girls around the world who remain out of school 27 million children in countries affected by conflict receive absolutely no education whatsoever. This has to change. Indeed, it must change. We are not even close to achieving our target when it comes to the important issue of education. On current estimates, it will take another 80 years to achieve the equality of opportunity that we said we will deliver in 15 [years]. The task is in front of us. That means decades of girls who should be growing up to be doctors, to be teachers, to be entrepreneurs and prime ministers and presidents as well, having their dreams, their hopes, their opportunities, their ambitions snatched away from them. It cannot be right. Simply put, it is wrong. We must change and we must act. That is why the United Kingdom government has pledged to put its full weight behind championing 12 quality years of education for every single girl around the world, truly to say that we leave no girl behind. Between 2015 and 2019, the United Kingdom has supported at least five point eight million girls to gain a decent education, including those living in conflict zones. But that is not enough. It is not good enough. And therefore, Mr President, Your Excellencies, on behalf of the United Kingdom government and our Prime Minister, in addition to the sums we have already committed for education around the world I use the opportunity today to announce that we are pledging a further £515 million, over half a billion pounds, to help over 12 million children, half of them girls, into school and most importantly, to keep them there. I call on everyone here on behalf of our Prime Minister to play their part and ensure that girls get the education they deserve, to get the opportunities they desire to fulfill the ambitions they have. You know what, your Excellencies, get this right and we together collaboratively, collectively will solve some of the most major problems of the world. We will solve many of the problems confronting humanity today. Delivering on all the SDGs, both home and abroad, matters to us all. They tackle the very issues that matter to people, to people in our country and my country and the United Kingdom and your country, to every country around the world. For we do care deeply about these important issues and we simply cannot achieve the SDGs if we leave half the global population behind. We must educate girls. We are committed to that. But it’s not about talk alone. We must act and we must act now. Thank you."

"Boris Johnson","Protecting small islands from climate change and natural disasters: Lord Ahmad's statement","27 September 2019","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/protecting-small-islands-from-climate-change-and-natural-disasters","My name is Tariq Ahmad, Lord Ahmad of Wimbledon. I am one of those developed states, as Minister of State in the Foreign Office, with the responsibility for the Commonwealth and the United Nations. I am also the Minister for the Caribbean. I remember all too well the challenges of climate change more broadly, but quite specifically, I was with the Prime Minister when Hurricane Maria actually hit the Caribbean. I saw myself, Prime Minister, the devastation in your country and working with teams. Again whilst the tragedy of the Bahamas is there for all of us to see, I think there has been progress over the last two years in terms of the nature of a coordinated response, the ability to get supplies there as quickly as possible, but undoubtedly – and you’re quite right, I’ve been listening to the various contributions – there is immense challenge. It’s not just about turning up and signing declarations. It’s not just even – and I speak as a major contributor – pledging funds and making those available. What we’re challenged by here is the ability for Small Island Developing States to actually access that particular finance and certainly I’m keen to hear, but also to share the fact that we recognise that. I’m delighted we’re joined by the World Bank. In a previous life, I spent 20 years in the City of London so I am acutely aware of some of the innovations in climate financing that we need to develop. And for that matter, I’m proud to announce also that in the early part of next year, notwithstanding some of our domestic challenges in the United Kingdom, we’re looking forward to hosting a specific meeting directly aimed at Small Island Developing States and their ability and improving the accessibility to access finance. And we’ll look forward to hosting that in London so we can get the mechanics addressed and the issues which are repeatedly raised with me. I hear all the time; “It’s all very well, Tariq, you know, you’ve announced as funding here,” but the ability to access that finally funding is a major hurdle. So I’m delighted to be here and look forward to the discussion Question: Accessing finance eligibility rules remain a challenge for many SIDS. How can we address the issue which SIDS face in this area? Answer: Well, I think partly in our opening remarks, we’ve sought to address that. I think undoubtedly the issue of our current systems and how finances access, frankly and bluntly put, aren’t geared towards enabling that accessibility. And that’s why, as I mentioned earlier, we’re seeking to address that issue quite directly by getting quite specifically - and I think this meeting is a great example of getting the ball rolling on it - but with a quite specific technical focus on what needs to be done. That includes getting the right financiers in the room, the right countries in the room, but most importantly the SIDs in the room as well so we can address directly the barriers on accessing finance. And as I said, we will be circulating details of that particular meeting. But I think what is very clear - I mean, I could go through a raft of announcements that we’ve made; Prime Minister Johnson, when he was here earlier in the week, in terms of the new contributions, in terms of the initiatives of climate change, that money, I come back to the point it is only as good as once it’s accessibility is there. Prime Minister, both of you know better than I. But as a minister who’s been around the Caribbean, I saw firsthand after Hurricane Maria and Hurricane Irma devastated the Caribbean, our territories were impacted. I remember walking around Grand Turk, the Turks and Caicos Islands, and actually there was a semblance of something from an old war movie for the Second World War. We understand the devastation. And I assure you, we’re an island state, the United Kingdom. We’re developed, but we’re an island state; we understand the challenges that’s posed. But the issues must be about accessibility. So what are the real barriers so that the systems reflect the money that is available? But I also, just picking up on the Chief Executive’s point from the World Bank, when you look at the stats, there has been money allocated, money is going through, but we still need to do much more in that sphere. Question: A more specific question, Excellency. The SAMOA Pathway requires a need to build a resilient economy in societies. What is the role of a country like United Kingdom in support of SIDS to address issues of resilience and climate change? Answer: Well, we were delighted to be asked by the Secretary-General to lead on the resilience strand. Again, experience of a wonderful insight into what needs to be done. From the hurricanes that hit in 2017 to where we are today. In the Bahamas – Darren isn’t here, but I can see a representative here – Darren Hadfield and I was constantly when the Hurricane Dorian hit the Bahamas. One of things we insured over the last two years, working with key partners in the region, working with partners who have interests in the region, such as the Netherlands and France, the United States, Canada, the Caribbean, our own overseas territories, is to establish, if I can put it very bluntly, a real checklist of who’s got what asset in the area, who’s got what capability in the area. Where should the coordination work? Simple things. For example, we went out early in the market to ensure that we already had contracts signed to enable whatever was required as an immediate response. Contracts had already been banked. So the question was, last year, thankfully, we didn’t need to trigger those. This year we have that. We can access those particular contracts and make it work. The other area is, of course, in terms of immediate relief and support. We have specifically allocated one of our own ships, RFA Mounts Bay, to the region. And again, in response to the challenge that Bahamas faced with Hurricane Dorian, it was the first vessel that was able to enter and provide that immediate relief. And if I could say so – and I’m sure, Prime Minister, you experienced this directly – is that not just that immediate physical relief, but it’s that hope that actually this has hit us and there’s people that care and it matters. That’s phase 1. Phase 2 is very much in terms of providing the structured financing. We haven’t quite specifically over the last few years focussed our attention in this respect. And since the hurricanes, we’ve invested, for example, £360 million on climate resilient infrastructure in nine specific Caribbean countries. That’s not just announcing it, but working with the Caribbean countries in terms of where that focus should be. We’ve also recently committed a further £1.4 billion to the Green Climate Fund, a fifth of which has been spent on Small Island Developing States. Now, high level – and of course we’ve got details of how that is being spent quite specifically, which I can certainly share with member states – but we have many states from the Caribbean present here today. I’ve certainly sought through working with them directly and also through organizations such as CDEMA that we are not a remote partner. We’re in the region, we’re working with you and we’ll continue to do so."
"Boris Johnson","Celebrating the 70th anniversary of the Commonwealth: speech by Melanie Hopkins","8 October 2019","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/celebrating-the-70th-anniversary-of-the-commonwealth-a-connected-commonwealth","Bula Vinaka. 2019 marks a significant milestone – the Commonwealth’s 70th anniversary. It’s great to see such a diverse group of people in the room tonight, from honourable parliamentarians, national representatives and colleagues from non-governmental organisations to young leaders, here to take part in this dialogue to prepare them for the challenge of shaping a better world for the next generation. The Commonwealth began as a family of 8 states who signed the London Declaration in 1949. In the intervening years the Commonwealth has grown to 53 member states, which is more than a quarter of UN member states. 2.4 billion people live in Commonwealth countries, which is a third of the world’s population. The Commonwealth makes up one-fifth of global trade, with the combined GDP of Commonwealth nations set to reach US$13trillion in 2020. The potential is huge. The ties that bind us in this region are deep-rooted and stretch back many years. A large number of countries in this region are members of the Commonwealth, including as Australia, Kiribati, Nauru, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu, and of course Fiji. The special strength of the Commonwealth lies in the combination of diversity and shared inheritance in language, culture and the rule of law; bound together by the shared history and tradition; by respect for all states. As the current Chair-in-Office, the United Kingdom is working with all member states to ensure the Commonwealth realise its potential. But what does it mean to be a Commonwealth member if you are from a Pacific country? The Commonwealth promotes shared values and inclusivity, helps harness talent, strengthens norms, amplifies the voices of small states, and helps tackle the big global challenges of the day such as extremism and climate change. The UK wants to play an active role in this connected Commonwealth. At the Heads of Government meeting last year, the then Foreign Secretary, now our Prime Minister Boris Johnson, announced that the UK would be opening 9 new diplomatic missions in Commonwealth countries, thereby increasing the number of British High Commissions around the world from 38 to 47. Three of those new missions are in the Pacific: in Tonga, Vanuatu and Samoa, thereby doubling our diplomatic presence in the region. We have also doubled the number of diplomatic staff at the High Commission in Suva and welcomed a new regional development counselor. As I noted at the start of this workshop, this evening event is part of the programme for the UK-funded Young Leaders Dialogue, which provides a platform where young people can acquire and share knowledge, engage in dialogue with respective national leaders, and foster networks for progressive development. It is funded through the Pacific Commonwealth Equality Project, which aims to increase the capacity of Pacific Island Countries to drive inclusive and equitable social change through good governance, respect for human rights, and fairer opportunities for politically, socially and economically marginalised communities. 60% of the population of the Commonwealth is aged under 30 so it is vital we engage with youth – they are the inspiration and driving force for the type of world we want for the next generation and beyond. The Commonwealth and its members are also active in tackling what might be the defining issue of our time and that is the threat of climate change. As Commonwealth nations, we recognise that we live on a shared planet with finite, common resources that must be managed for the benefit of all. The Commonwealth Blue Charter is encouraging sustainable development and protection of the ocean, along with initiatives such as the Commonwealth Marine Economy Programme, and the Commonwealth Clean Oceans Alliance. The UK is proud to be at the heart of these initiatives and we look forward to COP25 in Chile and beyond that to COP26 in Glasgow, key opportunities for us to drive global ambition."
"Boris Johnson","Tech UK conference 2019","8 October 2019","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/tech-uk-conference-2019","It’s a pleasure to be back in Manchester today, at Tech UK’s first flagship conference on skills and opportunities. And it’s a real honour to be addressing you as representatives of companies and technologies that, today, are defining the world we will live in tomorrow. As the Prime Minister said himself just last month in a speech to the UN, no one can ignore the gathering force of technology that is reshaping the future of each and every one of us. Every day, developments in digital technologies are pushing the boundaries of what is possible. And, together, your companies and innovations are stretching the limits of what humanity can achieve, and what the UK can achieve as a nation. The Prime Minister has rightly acknowledged the UK as “one of the world’s tech leaders”. And the facts speak for themselves: The tech sector in the UK contributes over 7% of UK (GVA). And, last year alone, Venture Capital funds invested £6.3 billion in UK tech. That’s more than in any other European country. UK investment in AI has also grown almost 6-fold in the 4 years between 2014 and 2018. All of this adds up to more jobs and more fast-growing companies. Our tech sector is going from strength to strength in front of our very eyes, growing at 50% faster than the rest of the UK economy. And as it grows, it transforms more and more lives in ways we never thought possible in the past. Thanks to great British technologies, many of us got here on a modern day version of Stephenson’s rocket, we are browsing the web on a browser first invented by Tim Berners-Lee, we’ll dry our hands on a Dyson hand dryer, and we might get tonight’s dinner delivered by a Deliveroo rider. However, advancements like this don’t simply happen overnight. They don’t just pop up out of thin air like magic. Instead, they are nurtured and cultivated through weeks, months, years and often decades of hard work, perseverance and dedication. What’s more, the path to success is not always clear. I’m sure most you in this room today have overcome obstacles and setbacks. But you persevered. And you found ways to succeed. Summoning ingenuity and imagination. Originality and determination. Cleverness and creativity. It is, ultimately, these very human values that allow technologies to emerge and flourish. And it is, therefore, people – people like you – that have made every single one of our tech successes in this country possible. People who have dedicated their entire lives to pushing forward the frontiers of knowledge and human capabilities. I am keenly aware that our tech sector won’t go on thriving if we don’t concentrate on people. On putting people and skills at the centre of our innovation system. On ensuring that our regulatory system is as modern as the technologies that it supports. And on ensuring that the whole of the UK benefits from our growing technology sector. So, let’s take keeping the brightest and best people in the sector first. How do we do it? Well, we need to recognise and address the challenges researchers and innovators face on a day-to-day basis. Developing a people-first research strategy is just one part of this. Last month, I was pleased to support the launch of the revised Concordat to Support the Career Development of Researchers. This encourages signatories from across higher education and innovation to work together on the challenges facing researchers in the world today. A world where research positions are shorter and more precarious than they used to be. A world, which relies on the continuous transfer of talented people between academia and industry. And a world where individuals may find themselves balancing heavy workloads with poor mental health and wellbeing. It is on all of us to ensure we are supporting people across the entire innovation and tech sector to be the best they can be. From researchers, academics and innovators, to technicians, postgraduates and post-docs. All of these people together are integral to the overall strength and prowess of UK tech. Embracing diversity in the sector is crucial to getting this right. As some of you may know, today is Ada Lovelace Day – an international celebration of the achievements of women in science, technology engineering and maths. And In a world where half the population are women, it isn’t right that the UK tech sector is still seen by many as a man’s world, despite recent improvements in the number of women entering STEM careers. On this, it’s great to see the work you’re already doing with the Tech Talent Charter, which is supported by government and aims to deliver greater inclusion and diversity in UK tech workforce – one that better reflects the make-up of the wider population. Over 400 organisations – from international tech giants right through to start-ups – have already signed the Charter, including the organiser’s of today’s event, TechUK. This government is determined to address the gender imbalance in tech careers, in particular by improving girls’ take-up of maths, computing and physics at all stages of the education system from primary school through to university. Initiatives like the ‘Women in Innovation’ programme from Innovate UK are also helping to get more women with excellent ideas innovating in UK businesses and boosting the economy. We’re keen that more people from currently under-represented groups, including those with disabilities and those from Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic communities, realise a career in tech can be for them as much as anyone else. That’s why schemes like the ‘Bristol and Bath Creative R&D Partnership’ are key to supporting businesses to find new ways to engage the audiences of the future and develop a diverse new talent base. Their aim is to make creative technology innovation available to the widest possible cross-section of talent. And that takes me on nicely to talk about how the sector can make the most of this and ensure it has the skills it needs. Investing in high-level technical skills for the whole country is paramount. I’m proud that this government is pumping millions into improving the UK’s STEM skills-base. Included in this is the £20 million invested by the Department for Education in the Institute for Coding. This was set up in 2017 specifically to address the high demand for skilled IT and digital specialists, and to better equip graduates with industry requirements. I’m delighted that the Institute for Coding consortium, led by the University of Bath, has now grown to include 37 higher education institutions and over one hundred employers. And it’s a pleasure to see 22,000 students having started on Institute for Coding courses in September. What’s more, it’s great to see the Institute for Coding continuing to make links to other government initiatives – not least the new Institutes of Technology we’re opening, with the express intention to provide students with university-level technical qualifications and a clear route to technical employment. Just last week the Secretary of State for Education announced we will make available up to an extra £120 million so we can have an Institute of Technology in every part of the country, and provide different regional economies with the unique mix of digital skills they t need to flourish. Here in Manchester, for example, government has invested £3 million in a pilot ‘Fast Track Digital Workforce Fund’, lead by GMCA. This brings together employers and training providers to find the digital skills solutions that meet their needs – while also helping local people move into better jobs. This will mean everybody, in every part of our great nation, will get the chance to gain the high-level digital skills both they and your businesses need. And we’re not just talking about young people here. About those who are taking A-Levels or indeed the new T-Levels, who want to progress to technical education. We’re also talking about adult learners. Those people who, later in life, want to access the further technical training they need. This latter point is something that is going to become ever more important as technology develops and the world of work as we know it changes. In the digital age, education is going to become a lifelong endeavour, not just something you do until you’re 18 or 21. But something individuals may want to revisit as our lives and circumstances change. Education in the so-called Fourth Industrial Revolution is not just about providing young people with skills. It’s about providing everyone with opportunities to re-skill and up-skill, at whatever age and whatever level they need it. That’s why we’ve put in place now a commitment to introduce a national entitlement to adult basic digital skills training from 2020. Adults without the digital skills needed for life and work will have the opportunity to study new qualifications free of charge, so that nobody gets left behind as the world around us inevitably moves on. Education in the digital age is ultimately about enabling society to adapt to new technologies and developments, and make the most of the opportunities they bring. AI is just one case in point. This government has already invested heavily in AI – most notably through the new Alan Turning AI Fellowships aimed at attracting and retaining the very top tech talent. And we will soon be launching the call to recruit the next cohort of fellows. This month will also see the first PhD students starting at our new AI Centres for Doctoral Training. A total of £100 million has been allocated for additional doctoral training focused on AI – providing training for around 1,000 additional PhD studentships in AI over the next 9 years. This will ensure that we have the AI experts we need working both in ground-breaking research and in innovative tech businesses across the country. But, if we’re serious about meeting our target to invest at least 2.4% of GDP in R&D by 2027 then we can’t just rely on home-grown talent alone. Creating a climate based on the free movement of talent is obviously going to be key to generating the numbers and diversity the sector needs. It probably hasn’t escaped your notice that, later this month, we are set to leave the European Union. I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again: Brexit may well mean that we are leaving the EU, but it certainly does not mean that we are leaving our European friends and partners behind. I’m going to be speaking on this very issue in more detail at a speech to the British Academy in London tomorrow, but for the purposes of this event, today, it is worth emphasising this government’s intention to remain open and international as we commit to getting Brexit done. The International Research and Innovation Strategy I launched earlier this year best evidences our commitment to global engagement in the science and tech sectors. And the International Education Strategy, launched the same month, sets out our ambition to increase the number of international higher education students studying in the UK by over 30% to 600,000 by 2030. This will undoubtedly increase the talent pool that will furnish our business and industries with the people, knowledge and ideas they require. And thanks to the hard work of my successor-come-predecessor, Jo Johnson, the introduction of the Graduate Route, or 2-year post-study work visa, will hopefully incentivise much of this talent to stay on our shores, work in our companies, and set up their own businesses. As a government, we know we must do everything we can to make the UK the most attractive place to come and start a tech business, to undertake new research directions, and to test and develop new technologies. That means having a dynamic, fit-for-purpose regulatory environment – an environment that enables new technologies to develop faster, to be tested at pace, and implemented and adopted in new and exciting ways. This isn’t just about removing the hurdles created by out-of-date rules and regulations. It’s about creating new standards and frameworks that provide confidence to investors and customers. I saw a great example of this when I visited the National Physical Laboratory in Teddington the other week. The important work they are doing with electric engines, with their hydrogen fuel cell testing rig, is all about taking this new technology and measuring its response to different qualities of hydrogen supply – stress-testing it, finding its limits, and developing new performance benchmarks and new standards. These will become the benchmarks and standards that others will build on, providing confidence to wider industry partners and investors, and in turn speeding up adoption of that all-important green technology. This is modern, smart regulation in action – regulation that can lift technology up, not squash it down. There are numerous similar examples of where our regulatory environment needs to adapt and where the old rules just don’t make sense – for instance in personalised medicine, autonomous vehicles and, of course, AI. This isn’t about creating the Wild West in tech. I firmly believe that standards and regulation, when done well, can allow new technologies to flourish. And these are the lessons that we will learn as we implement further regulatory reforms, building on our white paper on regulation in the fourth industrial revolution, which I welcomed earlier this year. This innovation is something that we are also seeing in the fintech sector – a sector that has grown considerably over the last few years, where smart and modern regulation has combined with investment and new technology to create a boom in new financial products and services in the UK. We have embraced this technology much faster than other nations, It is a shock to go to the US and still sign for a card purchase, for example. And when I went to the bank recently to complete my house purchase, it really felt like going back in time. It doesn’t have to be this way. And it’s not this way in many sectors and areas. But, while parts of London and the South East are now completely cash-less, this can’t be said of the whole country – and that brings me on to my last point. It cannot have escaped anyone’s notice that our Research and Innovation sector is incredibly concentrated in London and the South East. Per-capita spending on Research & Development in the North East is way under half that in London. The Golden Triangle is of course an incredible strength of ours – a magnet for foreign investment and talent, and a true national asset. But it is not enough to have this activity continue to be so concentrated. If we are to become an innovation nation, then we must learn from this, ensuring that the whole of the UK benefits from our tech revolution. This means ensuring that our most innovative SMEs can scale up and access seed funding as well as large grants, enter the market, and even shape new markets. And this is not just about investment. It is about ensuring that we create the kinds of spaces that tech firms want to be in, with the partners that they need to work with, and with the planning rules that allow for this. Not just in the Golden Triangle, but also developing and redeveloping new and existing spaces – in universities, cities and towns, bringing spill-over benefits and opportunities to communities right across the UK. I want us to build on the work we’ve done with University Enterprise Zones, which I launched last month, and to build on our amazing network of incubators, accelerators, catalysts and catapults – spreading the benefits right across the UK. To create a truly business-friendly environment. To join together research, development, and innovation. And to create a new unity of purpose. I also recognise that the UK doesn’t operate in isolation. And there is a real opportunity to learn from the best of what works abroad, from the Engine at MIT, to Station F in Paris. But I don’t just want one Station F – I’d love to see a whole alphabet of Stations, right across the UK, leaving no part of the UK behind. For as long as I’m Universities and Science Minister, I want to help the UK to find a new gear, to put the UK tech sector in the fast line, and to grow an incredible tech ecosystem that can accelerate into the future. I – like many of you – want to see a world where the UK is an innovation powerhouse. A powerhouse where the most talented people are not only free to come to, but actively want to come to. A powerhouse where people from all walks of life can take their inspiration and ideas forward. A powerhouse where ideas are nurtured and transformed into booming new businesses. And a powerhouse which gives us a platform on the global stage, and an edge in a rapidly developing world. As your Universities and Science Minister, I can assure you I am committed to building this powerhouse in the way I’ve just described. And I look forward to working with you to ensure the UK tech sector has the people and talent it needs for an ever digital future. Thank you."
"Boris Johnson","FT Africa Summit 2019: Minister for Africa's speech","14 October 2019","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/speech-by-andrew-stephenson-minister-for-africa-to-ft-africa-summit-october-2019","Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen. Good morning. It’s a great honour for me to speak today with so many eminent African leaders and experts, and to share a bit about the UK’s vision for our 21st century partnerships with African countries. When I was appointed the UK’s Minister for Africa in July, I told my team that I wanted to get to know my patch as quickly as possible. They took me at my word. I have been fortunate enough to visit Kenya, Mozambique, South Sudan, Somalia, South Africa, and Uganda in the first few weeks and there are more visits planned in the near future. I have met a whole cross section of people – from Presidents to peacekeepers and from leaders of major business to a person running a food stall in a refugee camp. Wherever I have been, I have found people receptive to the UK’s desire to a build modern, future-focused, mutually beneficial partnerships for prosperity. In my previous role as Minister for Business and Industry, I championed my government’s commitment to shared prosperity within the UK; to economic growth, good jobs, and prosperous communities in every region. The government’s ambitious vision for the UK’s partnerships with Africa is, at heart, no different. Under Prime Minister Boris Johnson, the UK has a vision of working together with African countries on innovation, forging new investments with sustainable impact that creates jobs and boosts prosperity for all through an enduring partnership. It is with this vision in mind that the UK will host the UK-Africa Investment Summit in London on the 20 January next year. The Summit will bring together businesses, governments and international institutions to encourage investment in a range of sectors that our African partners themselves have identified as their top priorities. It will be a chance to demonstrate to global business the scale of commercial opportunities in Africa. It will also be an opportunity for the UK to showcase our unique offer to investors and to our African partners. That offer comprises not just UK Export Finance and CDC, both of whom are increasing the scale and reach of their efforts in Africa, but also the wealth of expertise and capital available here in the City of London. The UK-Africa Investment Summit will do a range of things: Firstly, build strong UK-Africa commercial partnerships in key areas such as infrastructure, agriculture, manufacturing and renewables, showcasing innovation and technology from leading African and UK businesses. Secondly, position the City of London as global hub for capital and a gateway to Africa for financial investment; highlighting the UK’s investment expertise in areas such as early stage, green and local currency financing. And thirdly, create a modern partnership based on longer-term mutual prosperity between the UK and African countries, recognising achievements and sharing expertise including on things like energy transition. The UK-Africa Investment Summit is just one way we are working towards our vision of supporting long term investment, building strong partnerships, and working together to solve shared challenges in Africa. Let me briefly set out 3 key ways in which we are working with our African partners to achieve this. First, we are accelerating long-term, sustainable, direct investment across Africa. We are putting the full weight of the UK’s Finance Institutions – CDC, UK Export Finance, and other new mechanisms – behind the effort to leverage investment. We are also developing new financial products to enable African companies to access capital markets here in the City of London. This is tangible stuff, with clear impact, as I saw for myself when I visited what will soon become the new Kabaale International Airport in Uganda, a project supported by UK Export Finance. The second thing we are doing with our African partners is all about incentivising trade. We are working with African governments to help build regulatory environments that are conducive to trade and investment, and working together to align our rules and standards. We are working to help African governments make sure that businesses pay their way, by contributing to domestic revenue, so that governments can plough that revenue back into public services. This forms part of the UK’s wider commitment to good business, as seen in our Business Integrity Initiative against corruption, and our participation in the UN Global Compact and Ethical Trading Initiative. These are important initiatives to ensure that businesses around the world operate in a sustainable and just manner. We are working with African governments to promote trade itself and we are upbeat about progress. Total trade between the UK and Sub-Saharan Africa has grown by more than 7% in the past 18 months. I am particularly pleased that our new Economic Partnership Agreement with the Southern Africa Customs Union and Mozambique will sustain and strengthen future trade worth £10 billion a year. I am also pleased that we are able to provide technical support to the African Union as they roll out the African Continental Free Trade Area to help boost intra-African trade. The third and perhaps most important thing we are doing to achieve our vision in Africa is investing in our partnerships. This means connecting prosperity to long-term challenges like security and climate change, and facing those challenges together. For example, the Secretary of State for International Development Alok Sharma recently announced an Infrastructure Commission that aims to turbo charge investment in green, sustainable infrastructure. The commission will be made up of UK and international business leaders and will make recommendations to improve the planning, delivery and financing of infrastructure projects. Such projects form the backbone of economic growth. As part of investing in partnerships, we are radically expanding our presence in Africa, we are opening new missions and bringing in trade experts and investment specialists. It is our biggest uplift in activity and investment in Africa in a generation. We are all too aware that Africa’s young population will grow up in a very different world from the one many of us have known. That is why we are putting a new emphasis on the UK supporting African innovation, ingenuity and creativity – to solve global challenges and unlock future opportunities. For example, in Ghana, we partner on the Digital Finance Initiative, alongside the UK-Ghana Business Council; in South Africa we are partners in the Square Kilometre Array –helping to build a broader base of African science; and in Kenya, our Energy Access work is bringing clean solar power to homes across the country. I wish you a productive day and I hope our paths will cross many times in the coming weeks and months as we work towards our shared goal of an Africa that is more peaceful, more just and more prosperous for us all. Thank you."
"Boris Johnson","PM press conference at EU Council: 17 October 2019","17 October 2019","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-press-conference-at-eu-council-17-october-2019","I particularly thank Michel Barnier and his team. I thank Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the Commission, for all the personal effort that he has put in to getting this deal done. And I want to stress that this is a great deal for our country, for the UK. I also believe it is a very good deal for our friends in the EU. And what it means is that we in the UK can come out of the EU as one United Kingdom - England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, together, and it means we can decide our future together, we can take back control, as the phrase goes, of our money, our borders, our laws, together. And we will be able to do free trade agreements around the world. We can also build now, after three and a half years, we can build now on our relations with our friends and partners in the EU. And it’ll be a very exciting period now, as it were, to get to the positive side of that project - the extraction having been done, the building now begins. And I’m very confident that when my colleagues in Parliament study this agreement, that they will want to vote for it on Saturday, and then in succeeding days. This is our chance in the UK as democrats to get Brexit done, and come out on October the 31st. This is our chance to focus on our priorities, the people’s priorities, the NHS, putting 20,000 police on the streets, lifting up funding of education across the country, the biggest expansion of the living wage. Those are the things I think the people of our country want us to be focusing on in addition to Brexit. We have been at this now, as I say, for three and a half years. It hasn’t always been an easy experience for the UK. It has been long, it has been painful, it has been divisive, and now is the moment for us as a country to come together. Now this is the moment for our parliamentarians to come together and get this thing done, and, as I say, to begin building a new and progressive partnership with our EU friends, with whom, of course, we share so many priorities."

It’s been a very important debate, an exceptional moment for our country, an exceptional moment for our Parliament. Alas the opportunity to have a meaningful vote has been effectively been passed up because the meaningful vote has been voided of meaning. But I wish the House to know that I’m not daunted or dismayed by this particular result and I think it probably became likely once it was obvious that the amendment from my Right Honourable Friend the Member for West Dorset was going to remain on the order paper. I continue in the very strong belief that the best thing for the UK and for the whole of Europe is for us to leave with this new deal on October 31. And to anticipate the questions that are coming from the benches opposite, I will not negotiate a delay with the EU, and neither does the law compel me to do so. I will tell our friends and colleagues in the EU exactly what I’ve told everyone in the last 88 days that I’ve served as Prime Minister: that further delay would be bad for this country, bad for the European Union and bad for democracy. So next week the Government will introduce the legislation needed for us to leave the EU with our new deal on October 31. And I hope that our European Union colleagues and friends will not be attracted as the benches opposite are by delay. I don’t think they’ll be attracted by delay. And I hope that then Honourable Members faced with a choice of our new deal, our new deal for the UK and the European Union, will change their minds because it was pretty close today. I hope that they will change their minds and support this deal in overwhelming numbers. Since I became Prime Minister I‘ve said we must get on and get Brexit done on October 31 so that this country can move on. Mr Speaker, that policy remains unchanged, no delays, and I will continue to do all I can to get Brexit done on October 31 and I continue to commend this excellent deal, Mr Speaker, to the House."

"Boris Johnson","PM statement in the House of Commons: 19 October 2019","19 October 2019","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-statement-in-the-house-of-commons-19-october-2019","Mr Speaker, I want to begin by echoing what you’ve just said, my gratitude to all members of the House for assembling on a Saturday for the first time in 37 years and indeed to all members of the House of Commons staff who have worked to make this possible. I know this has meant people giving up their Saturdays, breaking into their weekends at a time when families want to be together, and of course it means missing at least the end of England’s World Cup quarter final. I apologies to the House for that and I wish I could watch it myself. I know the Honourable Member for Cardiff West has postponed his 60th birthday party – if not his 60th birthday – to be here. So Mr Speaker the House has gone to a great deal of trouble to assemble here on a Saturday for the first time in a generation. And I do hope for the purposes of a meaningful vote that we will indeed be allowed to have a meaningful vote this evening. And with permission, Mr Speaker, I shall make a statement on the new agreement with our European friends. The House will need no reminding that this is the second deal and the fourth vote, three and half years after the nation voted for Brexit. And during those years, friendships have been strained, families divided and the attention of this House consumed by a single issue that has at times felt incapable of resolution. But I hope Mr Speaker, that this is the moment when we can finally achieve that resolution and reconcile the instincts that compete within us. Many times in the last 30 years I have heard our European friends remark that this country is half-hearted in its EU membership and it is true that we in the UK have often been a backmarker opting out of the single currency, not taking part in Schengen, very often trying to block some collective ambition. And in the last three years and a half years it has been striking that members on all sides of this House have debated Brexit in almost entirely practical terms in an argument that has focused on the balance of economic risk and advantage. And I don’t think I can recall a time when I have heard a single member stand up and call for Britain to play her full part in the political construction of a federal Europe. I don’t think I’ve heard a single member call for an ever closer union or ever deeper integration or a federal destiny – mon pays Europe - perhaps I’ve missed it but I don’t think I’ve heard much of it Mr Speaker. And there is a whole side of that debate that you hear regularly in other European capitals that is simply absent from our national conversation and I don’t think that has changed much in the last 30 years. But if we have been sceptical, and if we have been anxious about the remoteness of the bureaucracy, if we have been dubious about the rhetoric of union and integration, if we have been half-hearted Europeans, Then it follows logically that with part of our hearts, with half our hearts, we feel something else, a sense of love and respect for European culture and civilisation of which we are a part; a desire to cooperate with our friends and partners in everything, creatively, artistically, intellectually. A sense of our shared destiny and a deep understanding of the eternal need – especially after the horrors of the last century - for Britain to stand as one of the guarantors of peace and democracy in our continent. And it is our continent. And it is precisely because we are capable of feeling both things at once - sceptical about the modes of EU integration as we are but passionate and enthusiastic about Europe - that the whole experience of the last few years has been so difficult for this country and so divisive. And that is why it is now so urgent for us to move on and build a new relationship with our friends in the EU on the basis of a new deal - a deal that can heal the rift in British politics, unite the warring instincts in us all. And now is the time for this great House of Commons to come together and bring the country together today as I believe people at home are hoping and expecting, with a new way forward and a new and better deal both for Britain and our friends in the EU, and that is the advantage of the agreement that we have struck with our friends in the last two days. Because this new deal allows the UK - whole and entire - to leave the EU on October 31st in accordance with the referendum while simultaneously looking forward to a new partnership based on the closest ties of friendship and co-operation. And I pay tribute to our European friends for escaping the prison of existing positions and showing the vision to be flexible by re-opening the Withdrawal Agreement and thereby addressing the deeply felt concerns of many in this House. And one of my most important jobs is to express those concerns to our European friends. I shall continue to listen to all Honourable Members throughout the debate today, to meet with anyone on any side and to welcome the scrutiny the House will bring to bear if - as I hope – we proceed to consider the Withdrawal Agreement Bill next week. Today this House has an historic opportunity to show the same breadth of vision as our European neighbours. The same ability and resolve to reach beyond past disagreements by getting Brexit done and moving this country forwards, as we all yearn to do. This agreement provides for a real Brexit, taking back control of our borders, laws, money, farming, fisheries and trade, amounting to the greatest single restoration of national sovereignty in Parliamentary history. It removes the backstop which would have held us against our will in the Customs Union and much of the Single Market. For the first time in almost five decades the UK will be able to strike free trade deals with our friends across the world to benefit the whole country – including Northern Ireland. Article 4 of the Protocol states: “Northern Ireland is part of the customs territory of the United Kingdom”. It adds “nothing in this Protocol shall prevent” Northern Ireland from realising the preferential market access in any free trade deals “on the same terms as goods produced in other parts of the United Kingdom.” Our negotiations have focused on the uniquely sensitive nature of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic. And we have respected those sensitivities. Above all, we and our European friends have preserved the letter and the spirit of the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement and upheld the long-standing areas of co-operation between the UK and Ireland, including the Common Travel Area. And as I told the House on 3rd October, in order to prevent a regulatory border on the island of Ireland we proposed a regulatory zone covering all goods, including agrifood, eliminating any need for associated checks along the border. And Mr Speaker, in this agreement we have gone further by also finding a solution to the vexed question of customs, which many in this House have raised. Our agreement ensures – and I quote – “unfettered market access for goods moving from Northern Ireland to the rest of the United Kingdom’s internal market.” It ensures that there should be no tariffs on goods circulating within the UK customs territory, that is between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, unless they are at risk of entering the EU. It ensures an open border on the island of Ireland, a common objective of everyone in this House. And it ensures that for those living and working alongside the border there will be no visible or practical changes to their lives – they can carry on as before. I believe this is a good arrangement, reconciling the special circumstances in Northern Ireland with the minimum possible bureaucratic consequences at a few points of arrival into Northern Ireland. And it is precisely to ensure that those arrangements are acceptable to the people of Northern Ireland that we have made consent a fundamental element of this new deal. So no arrangements can be imposed on Northern Ireland if they do not work for Northern Ireland. The people of Northern Ireland will have the right under this agreement to express or withhold their consent to these provisions, by means of a majority vote in their Assembly four years after the end of the transition. And if the Assembly chooses to withhold consent, these provisions “shall cease to apply” after two years, during which the Joint Committee of the UK and EU would propose a new way forward, in concert with Northern Ireland’s institutions. And as soon as this House allows the process of extracting ourselves from the EU to be completed, the exciting enterprise of building our new relationship with our friends can begin which has been too long delayed. And Mr Speaker, I do not wish this to be the project of any one Government or any one party but rather the endeavour of the United Kingdom as a whole. Only this Parliament can make this new relationship the work of the nation. And so Parliament should be at the heart of decision-making as we develop our approach. And I acknowledge that in the past we have not always acted in that spirit. So as we take forward our friendship with our closest neighbours and construct that new relationship I will ensure that a broad and open process draws upon the wealth of expertise in every part of this House including select committees and their chairs. Every party and every Member who wishes to contribute will be invited to do so. And we shall start by debating the mandate for our negotiators in the next phase. Mr Speaker, the ambition for our future friendship is contained in the revised Political Declaration which also provides for this House to be free to decide our own laws and regulations. I have complete faith in this House to choose regulations that are in our best tradition of the highest standards of environmental protections and workers’ rights. No one anywhere in this chamber believes in lowering standards, instead we believe in improving them as indeed we will be able to do and seizing the opportunities of our new freedoms. For example, free from the Common Agricultural Policy, we will have a far simpler system where we will reward farmers for improving our environment and animal welfare many of whose provisions are impossible under the current arrangements, instead of just paying them for their acreage. And free from the Common Fisheries Policy, we can ensure sustainable yields based on the latest science not outdated methods of setting quotas. And these restored powers will be available not simply to this Government but to every future British Government of any party to use as they see fit. That is what restoring sovereignty means, that is what is meant in practice by taking back control of our destiny. And our first decision, on which I believe there will be unanimity is that in any future trade negotiations with any country our National Health Service will not be on the table. Mr Speaker, I am convinced that an overwhelming majority in this House, regardless of our personal views, wishes to see Brexit delivered in accordance with the referendum. A majority. And in this crucial mission there can no longer be any argument for further delay. As someone who passionately believed that we had to go back to our European friends to seek a better agreement, I must tell the House that with this new deal the scope for fruitful negotiation has run its course. They said that we couldn’t re-open the Withdrawal Agreement, Mr Speaker, they said we couldn’t change a comma of the Withdrawal Agreement, they said we couldn’t abolish the backstop, Mr Speaker, we’ve done both. But it is now my judgement that we have reached the best possible solution. So those who agree, like me that Brexit must be delivered and who - like me – prefer to avoid a no deal outcome, must abandon the delusion that this House can delay again. And I must tell the House in all candour that there is very little appetite among our friends in the EU for this business to be protracted by one extra day. They have had three and a half years of this debate. It has distracted them from their own projects and their own ambitions and if there is one feeling that unites the British public with a growing number of the officials of the EU it is a burning desire to get Brexit done. and I must tell the House again in all candour that whatever letters they may seek to force the government to write, it cannot change my judgment that further delay is pointless, expensive and deeply corrosive of public trust. And people simply will not understand how politicians can say with one breath that they want delay to avoid no deal and then with the next breath that they still want delay when a great deal is there to be done. Now is the time Mr Speaker to get this thing done, and I say to all members let us come together as democrats to end this debilitating feud. Let us come together as democrats behind this deal, the one proposition that fulfils the verdict of the majority but which also allows us to bring together the two halves of our hearts, to bring together the two halves of our nation. Let’s speak now both for the 52 and the 48. Let us go for a deal that can heal this country, let’s go for a deal that can heal this country and allow us all to express our legitimate desires for the deepest possible friendship and partnership with our neighbours A deal that allows us to create a new shared destiny with them. And a deal that also allows us to express our confidence in our own democratic institutions, to make our own laws, to determine our own future, to believe in ourselves once again as an open, generous global, outward-looking and free-trading United Kingdom. That is the prospect that this deal offers our country. It is a great prospect and a great deal, and I commend it to the House."
"Boris Johnson","Conor Burns celebrates 2,000 year old Tunisian trade links","22 October 2019","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/conor-burns-celebrates-2000-year-old-tunisian-trade-links","Good morning friends. Thank you, Louise de Sousa, Ambassador to Tunis. Thank you for the invitation to join you this morning. On behalf of the Her Majesty’s Government, I’d like to extend a very warm welcome to Mr Abassi, Governor of the Central Bank of Tunisia, and all of the senior delegation from the government of Tunisia today. And may I also take a moment to thank Ambassador Ben Kheder and his team at the Tunisian Embassy in London, as well as the Developing Markets Association and the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development, for the enormous amount of time and effort that has gone into putting on such a great programme today. I was delighted to receive the Tunisian Ambassador’s invitation to speak. This forum represents a superb opportunity to reflect on the current UK-Tunisia economic partnership, and look towards further opportunities for collaboration in key sectors. And for businesses, this is a unique chance to develop your relationships, networks and understanding of the investment environment. Looking around the room, I’m particularly pleased to see such a strong turnout from the private sector, including Clarke Energy, BP, Vodafone, Credit Suisse, Shell and Hewlett Packard to name just a few. That speaks to our shared appetite for strengthening trading, investment and commercial collaboration between Tunisia and the UK, and that businesses are switched on to the diverse opportunities out there waiting be grasped. UK-Tunisia Association Agreement And we have a firm foundation on which to build those opportunities. Back in September I met with Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Bachtobji and Ambassador Ben Khedher at the sixth Tunisia-UK Bilateral Forum here in London, where both sides committed to finalising a broad bilateral UK-Tunisia Association Agreement to strengthen co-operation between our 2 countries. A month later that agreement is now signed. This is testament to the hard work and strong will on both sides to realise our shared long-term ambitions for a deeper economic partnership. We now look forward to working ever more closely to ensure its speedy ratification. The agreement provides vital certainty and stability for both UK and Tunisian firms that the trading arrangements between us can continue, uninterrupted. But this is not just about continuity in our trading relationship. It’s also a historic opportunity to strengthen and deepen our trade and investment relationship for the years to come. Both the UK and Tunisia find ourselves in periods of transition. Times of transition offer great challenge, but also, I believe, of opportunity, to those who are willing to grasp it. Doing so must be a joint endeavour on both sides, incorporating government but also the private sector. Businesses like yours will be at the very forefront of this new dawn in the UK-Tunisia partnership. UK-Tunisia trade Now many people might be surprised to hear that Tunisia and the UK are, in fact, very longstanding trading partners. If you take a mere 2 hour drive up the A350 from my constituency in Bournemouth, you will find yourself in the charming village of Saltford. It was here 4 years ago, that a fascinating discovery was made. Nestled amongst the silt deposited after the River Avon burst its banks, a tiny copper coin was unearthed, bearing the image of the goddess Tanit, chief deity of Carthage. Dated by experts to 2,300 years old, it indicates an ancient trade route stretching all the way from the Mediterranean to Britain. This remarkable little coin tells us that even our Iron Age ancestors had identified the benefits of a strong trading relationship between us! In the twelve months ending March 2019, total trade between the UK and Tunisia was worth £400 million, an increase of 8.4% compared with the previous 12 months. I’d like to see that figure grow still further in the coming years. There is so much potential there as our bilateral relationship continues to move from strength to strength. Against a backdrop of protectionism gripping some parts of the world, it is important that we look outwards: towards new markets and commercial partnerships where the opportunities of the future can be found. And Tunisia is very much among these. In an era of increasing globalisation and ever evolving technologies, we no longer have to be confined to the same old trading relationships. We are better equipped than ever to connect with friends and partners across the world, and to seize the global opportunities laid out before us. UK-Africa Investment Summit In that spirit, the UK is looking forward to hosting the UK-Africa Investment Summit in London on 20 January as a chance to demonstrate the scale of commercial opportunities in Africa, as well as to showcase the UK’s unique offer to investors and our African partners. Under Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who will host the event, the UK has a clear vision of working together with African countries on innovation, forging new investments that will creates jobs, and boosting our mutual prosperity through a strong and enduring partnership. And of course we will particularly look forward to welcoming the Tunisian government to London again so soon, and to building on the momentum of today’s forum. UK-Tunisia investment I am truly delighted that Tunisia was the first country in the North African region to sign a continuity agreement with the UK. I think that says a huge amount about the Tunisian character; outward looking, forward thinking, and ready to embrace new opportunities. That’s why Tunisia has become an obvious entry point for firms looking to invest in Africa, and it’s become easier than ever to tap into opportunities in the Tunisian market. Tunisian government initiatives such as the 2016 Investment Code, the 2018 Start-Up Act, and the new Horizontal Law have done so much to simplify procedures for investors, and make Tunisia an increasingly enticing prospect. The Central Bank of Tunisia has played a key role in leading the country’s financial reform agenda, and I’m delighted that Mr Abassi is heading the delegation from Tunisia today. I’m so pleased that the UK, via our embassy team in Tunis, has been able to support the central bank in these vital reforms. From the UK side too, we are keen to support those pioneering firms looking to grow their business in Tunisia. That’s where our world-leading export credit agency UK Export Finance comes in. UK Export Finance provides an additional level of security for UK businesses and has substantial capacity to support exporters selling to Tunisia, with a risk appetite of up to £2 billion. We know how much companies who use UK Export Finance’s products value them, and we are keen to see them taken up more. UK-Tunisia investment relationship Historically, the UK-Tunisia investment relationship has focused heavily on oil and gas. Though maintaining and strengthening investments in this sector is a priority, I think the sectors represented here today show that we are ready to take a step further. To move beyond these traditional investment areas and embrace the plethora of new opportunities presenting themselves. I mentioned a moment ago that I attended the Tunisia-UK Bilateral Forum back in September, and I heard so much there that left me excited me about the prospects for our trade partnership. The UK and Tunisia are natural partners, sharing a number of key interests and strengths in areas like energy, technology and agrifood. So there is certainly no shortage of fertile ground to develop our trade and investment links further. On energy, UK companies have already made significant bids for solar energy projects in response to the tendering process launched by the Tunisian government this year. We want the UK to be a key partner in this sector, sharing our technical and commercial expertise to contribute to Tunisia’s clean energy reforms and the welfare of our planet. On technology, both countries are leaders in innovation in their respective regions. The UK is home to over 70 tech unicorns - businesses valued at over $1 billion - and Tunisia’s burgeoning tech credentials are growing all the time. If we look at artificial intelligence, Tunisia ranked second in Africa in the Government AI Readiness Index this year, and again, there is a major opportunity for collaboration with the UK. The UK government has put artificial intelligence at the forefront of our modern industrial strategy, and the UK is internationally renowned for its work in this field. But energy and technology are just the tip of the iceberg. Beyond these sectors, we also see significant promise in infrastructure, with the Tunisian Public Private Partnership Authority working closely with the UK on opportunities there. Likewise in tourism, we have seen steadily increasing numbers in response to security reforms. It is no secret that this area took quite a tumble following the barbaric and tragic attacks in 2015, but it is now making a real comeback. It’s my sincere hope that travellers will continue to gain confidence and rediscover the fantastic Tunisian climate, culture and people! Conclusion With the UK’s imminent departure from the EU, an incoming new Tunisian government, a new bilateral trade agreement in place, and the upcoming Africa Investment Summit, the timing really could not be better to delve into the pool of opportunities for UK-Tunisia trade and investment. Paul Arkwright, CEO of the UK-Africa Investment Summit will tell you more about the event, and the UK’s investment offer to Tunisia, later. I hope to see many of you there in the new year! So once again, I urge all the business leaders and investors here today to take advantage of this chance to learn more about the exciting opportunities available in Tunisia. You won’t regret it. Thank you."
"Boris Johnson","PM's statement on the Grenfell Phase One report: 30 October 2019","30 October 2019","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pms-statement-on-the-grenfell-phase-one-report-30-october-2019","Before I begin, let me say I will be making quite a lengthy speech this afternoon, reflecting the very comprehensive nature of the report. So if Hon and Rt Hon members bear with me I am sure that I will address whatever issues they may be planning to intervene on. Mr Speaker, the bereaved, the survivors, and the members of the north Kensington community joining us in the galleries today each have their own story to tell, their own perspective on what happened at Grenfell. But, over the past two-and-a-half years, they have been united in their fight to uncover the truth. It is not a fight they would ever have chosen. But it is one that they have taken up with determination, with dedication, and with great dignity. Yet their exceptional tenacity in seeking justice has not always been matched by their faith in the system’s ability to deliver. This is no surprise. After all, they have been let down many times before. Too often overlooked and ignored in the months and years before the tragedy. And, shamefully, failed by the institutions that were supposed to serve them in the days and weeks after it. Since then the survivors, the bereaved and the local community have endured one unbearable milestone after another. The funerals. The anniversaries. Giving and hearing evidence at the public inquiry. The painful process of building a new life in a new home without loved ones and without treasured possessions. And then the publication of this report today. And all this while carrying with them the unimaginable trauma suffered that night. I am very much aware that no report, no words, no apology will ever make good the loss suffered and the trauma experienced. But I hope that the findings being published today, and the debate we are holding this afternoon, will bring some measure of comfort to those who suffered so much. They asked for the truth. We promised them the truth. We owe them the truth. And, today, the whole country, the whole world, is finally hearing the truth about what happened at Grenfell Tower on the 14th of June 2017. When the sun rose over London that morning, it revealed an ugly scar of black smoke cutting across an otherwise clear blue summer sky – and, on the streets of north Kensington, a scene of horror and desperation. Shortly before one o’clock that morning a faulty fridge-freezer had started a small fire in the kitchen of a flat on the fourth floor of the 24-storey Grenfell Tower. The resident of that flat did everything right. He raised the alarm, called the fire brigade, alerted his neighbours. Within five minutes firefighters arrived to deal with what appeared to be a routine incident. And in the normal course of events, the fire would have been contained, extinguished, and that would have been that. But what happened that night was anything but normal. And so, even before firefighters began to tackle the blaze on the inside of the tower, unbeknown to them flames were already beginning to race up the outside. Just seven minutes after the first firefighters entered the kitchen on the fourth floor, a resident on the 22nd dialled 999 to report the blaze at her level, almost 200 feet higher up. By 1:27am a column of fire had reached the roof. One whole side of the building was ablaze. Dense smoke and searing flames, visible across the capital, began wrapping around the tower, penetrating its heart. And by 1:30am, less than three-quarters-of-an-hour after it began, it was clear to those watching below that the inferno was completely out of control. Grenfell Tower – filled that night with almost 300 souls in its 129 flats – was beyond saving. The fire that shocked the nation and the world that June morning took the lives of 72 men, women and children. The oldest, known simply as Sheila, was a poet, artist and great-grandmother, who had brought joy to many and seen and experienced much in her 84 years. The youngest, Logan Gomes, had never even seen his own parents – he was stillborn hours after his mother made a narrow escape from the choking, noxious smoke. Many who lived together died together: husbands and wives, parents and children, were found in each other’s arms. Those who survived saw everything they owned reduced to dust and ash – wedding dresses, irreplaceable photographs, beloved children’s toys, all gone. And the true scale of the trauma – the impact of the fire not only on those who survived but those who lost loved ones or witnessed its destruction – is unlikely ever to be known. Grenfell represented the biggest loss of life in a single incident in the UK since the Hillsborough tragedy 28 years previously. However my predecessor as Prime Minister, the Rt Hon Member for Maidenhead, was determined that there would be no repeat of the travesty that followed that disaster – which saw the friends and families of those who died forced to fight the establishment tooth and nail, year after year, decade after decade to secure justice for their loved ones. That is why, just 15 days after the tragedy, the then Prime Minister appointed one of our most experienced and respected former judges, Sir Martin Moore-Bick, to lead a rigorous, public and completely independent inquiry into what happened. Sir Martin has today published his report on the first Phase of that inquiry, covering the events of 14 June. The cause of the fire and its rapid spread, and the way in which emergency services and others handled the immediate response. As the sponsoring Minister under the terms of the Inquiries Act 2005, I have this morning laid copies of the report before Parliament. I was in no doubt that the House should have the opportunity to debate it on the day of publication. Grenfell was a national tragedy – and this is a report of great national importance. However I recognise that Sir Martin has produced a very substantial piece of work, almost a thousand pages across four volumes. And the vast majority of Hon and Rt Hon members will not yet therefore have had the opportunity to digest and analyse it in any great detail. I believe that Members do have an important role to play in scrutinising such reports and the government’s response to them. So let me reassure the House that we will seek to schedule a further debate on Sir Martin’s findings at the earliest suitable opportunity so that members can debate the report in detail. This may obviously be after the election – but we will ensure it will happen. But of course what happened in the hours that the fire raged is only half the story. Phase two of the inquiry, which will start taking oral evidence early in the new year, will look at the wider context. And this will include the nature and application of building regulations, the way in which local and central government responded to the fire, and the handling of concerns raised by tenants over many years. Phase one sets out WHAT happened; phase two will explain WHY. And such a complex process will inevitably take time. Longer than any of us would wish. But, as I said, we owe it to the people of Grenfell Tower to explain, once and for all and beyond all doubt, exactly why the tragedy unfolded as it did. And, with the standard set by this first report, I am confident that is exactly what will happen. Sir Martin’s work is exhaustive in its detail. He provides an authoritative and often harrowing minute-by-minute account of the fire and its terrifying spread. Led always by the facts, his recommendations are clear and numerous. And where there are failings to be highlighted, Sir Martin does so without fear or favour. Nowhere is that clearer than in Sir Martin’s verdict on the single biggest cause of this tragedy. He leaves no doubt that the cladding on the exterior of Grenfell Tower was the defining factor in the rapid and all-consuming spread of the blaze. It was the cladding – the aluminium composite material rain screen and the combustible insulation behind it – that ignited because of the fire in flat 16. It was the cladding that allowed the flames to climb so rapidly up the outside of the tower, causing compartmentation to fail. And it was the cladding that turned into molten plastic, raining fire on the streets of north Kensington and causing the blaze to travel down and down the building as well as up. In short it was the cladding that turned a routine and containable kitchen fire into a disaster of unprecedented proportions that cost 72 people their lives. Sir Martin is clear that the cladding on Grenfell Tower was fitted in breach of building regulations. And why this was allowed to happen – and who was responsible for it – will be covered in phase two of his inquiry. But we cannot afford to stand by and wait for his full conclusions. As the report says, it is essential that all similar cladding is removed as quickly as possible. That is why the previous Government established a fund to pay for the removal of such systems from tall residential buildings. I’m pleased to say that all such buildings owned by central and local government have now had their cladding removed, and are undergoing work to remove it or at the very least have such work scheduled. In the private sector progress is slower. Too many building owners have not acted responsibly. While the people living in those privately owned buildings are safe – round-the-clock fire patrols and other temporary measures ensure that is the case – I’m in no doubt they need a long-term and lasting solution. Nearly all private high rise residential buildings where such cladding remains are now in line to have remedial work scheduled. Where that is not case, the government will work with local authorities to take enforcement action if landlords refuse to deal with the problems themselves. I think the House would agree they’ve had enough time. There are no more excuses. Make those buildings safe or face the consequences. The cladding on Grenfell Tower caused the fire to spread out of control and to behave in ways nobody had seen before. And this unprecedented fire created an unprecedented challenge for the many men and women sent to fight it. Mr Speaker, since 2017 much has been written, from many perspectives, about the way in which the London Fire Brigade handled the unfolding disaster. So let me be very clear from the start. After examining all the evidence and listening to hundreds of witnesses and experts, Sir Martin does not call into doubt the actions or bravery of any of the rank-and-file firefighters dispatched to Grenfell Tower. No one or any of us in this House or the Other Place. As mayor of this great city I saw for myself the courage and commitment demonstrated by the men and women of the London Fire Brigade. And as Sir Martin report bears that out, telling of firefighters exhibiting and I quote “extraordinary courage and selfless devotion to duty” as they pushed themselves “to and even beyond the limits of endurance”, facing choking smoke and temperatures as high as a thousand degrees Celsius. Their work that night was nothing short of phenomenal. However, Sir Martin concludes that the firefighters on duty that night were “faced with a situation for which they had not been properly prepared”. He finds that the London Fire Brigade’s planning and training for such an incident were “gravely inadequate” and that on the night of the fire there were “serious deficiencies” I quote in command and control. The report highlights a lack of co-ordination between emergency services – what Sir Martin calls a “serious failure” of stated policies. And I think this will be the point that will be of most concern to those who lost loved ones – he finds that the failure to order an evacuation of the tower once the fire was clearly out of control most probably led to the deaths of individuals who could otherwise have been saved. The so-called “stay put” policy is the bedrock on which all plans for fighting fires in tall residential buildings are based. Building regulations are supposed to mean that fires cannot spread beyond individual flats, that they are compartmented. When that is the case, it is indeed safest for most residents to stay in their homes until the fire is extinguished. But at Grenfell, that was the not case. The fire spread – both widely and rapidly – up, and down and across the tower. The inquiry found that, by 1:30am, it was clear that compartmentation had failed. By 1:50am it was still not too late to order an evacuation. Yet, according to Sir Martin, senior officers simply could not conceive of a situation where compartmentation could fail so comprehensively. In the report, “stay put” is described as such an article of faith within the fire service that senior officers were reluctant to let the reality before them override their training. And as a result, the decision to order an evacuation was not taken until 2:35am – by which time the tower’s single staircase was already filling with impenetrable smoke. Even after this time, poor and confused lines of communication meant that operators in the 999 control room were not aware that the advice had changed. Swamped by the sheer volume of calls and dealing with a challenge well outside their experience and training, some continued to give conflicting advice to callers trapped inside the tower. Sir Martin notes that many operators did not realise how all-encompassing the fire had become until well after 5am, when a lull in calls allowed them to check their phones and see images of the burning building for the first time. Information gleaned from callers inside the tower was faithfully recorded, but only rarely made its way to firefighters who could act upon it. While brave firefighters led many people to safety from inside the tower, Sir Martin concludes the chaos and confusion meant that some calls for help were not responded to until it was too late. Sir Martin cautions against making judgements at a distance, and I agree with him wholeheartedly It is very easy for us, on these green benches, to have 20:20 hindsight. And we are not about to run into the heart of a fire that is blazing more than 200 feet into the night sky. And while I believe it is vital that individuals are held accountable for their errors, we must do so carefully. It is clear from this report that the firefighters on the ground were in a position they should never have been in… Doing their damnedest to tackle a fire that should never have been allowed to happen. But that does not absolve us of responsibility. We must ensure that the failures identified by the inquiry are corrected. For not only does Sir Martin highlight that mistakes made by the London Fire Brigade in responding to the Lakanal House fire were repeated, he also raises concerns that the London Fire Brigade is “at risk of not learning the lessons of the Grenfell Tower fire”. It is vital that they do so. And I’m sure everyone at the London Fire Brigade will want to do so. Because, as an MP, as mayor or as a journalist, I have never met a firefighter who was anything less than totally committed to public safety. And I will be working with the London Fire Brigade, the mayor’s office, and local authorities across London to ensure the lessons of Grenfell are learned and Londoners are made safer for it. I can confirm that, where Sir Martin recommends responsibility for fire safety be taken on by central government, we will legislate accordingly. And, more widely, we plan to accept, in principle, all of the recommendations that Sir Martin makes of central government. We will set out how we plan to do so as quickly as possible. But I can assure the House – and all those affected by the Grenfell tragedy – that where action is called for, action will follow. Mr Speaker, for the survivors, the bereaved, and the local community this report will prove particularly harrowing. Yet I hope it will strengthen their faith in Sir Martin’s desire to determine the facts of the fire – and this government’s commitment to airing those facts in public, no matter how difficult they may be, and acting on them. That commitment is absolute. Because if any good is to come of this senseless tragedy – a tragedy that should never have happened… If it is to become a catalyst for a change in our approach to fire safety and indeed to social housing more widely, then we must get to the truth about what happened and why. We must expose and fix the failings that allowed an otherwise safe building to become so dangerous… That allowed a small kitchen fire to become a devastating inferno… That led to so many people being told to stay in their homes when they could and should have been fleeing to safety. The inquiry is a vital part of that. I would like to thank Sir Martin and his team for all their work so far, and I know that all current and former ministers, civil servants and all public sector workers will fully co-operate with phase two. But while I know that in uncovering the truth is very important to the survivors and bereaved, it is not the only aspect of the post-Grenfell story that requires our attention. So we will continue – as the previous Prime Minister promised – to support the affected families, long after the television cameras are gone. We will continue the work of the Grenfell Ministerial Recovery Group, which brings together the efforts of all parts of Government, central and local, in meeting the needs of the community. We will continue work to ensure that a beautiful and appropriate memorial is created on the site of the tower – a process that is being led by the bereaved and the local community. We will continue to make sure that those affected by the fire have an active and engaging role to play in implementing the lessons of Grenfell – including working closely with the Ministry of Housing to develop the policies in our social housing white paper. We will continue to implement the findings of the Hackitt review of building regulations. And I have asked the civil servants responsible for implementing Sir Martin’s recommendations to provide me with regular and frequent updates on their progress. I will not allow the lessons of this tragedy to fall through the cracks. Mr Speaker, the night of 14 June was a horrendous night. But in the darkness we have also seen the best of humanity. The residents who sacrificed their own lives to save their children or neighbours. The local community that rallied around in such an incredible fashion, holding the survivors in a tight embrace as the authorities failed to step up. And the people here with us today. The bereaved and the survivors. Those who would have every reason to hide away, but who have instead fought to uncover the truth about what happened that terrible night. Who have forced themselves to relive, time and again, the kind of trauma that most of us, mercifully, cannot begin to imagine. And who have dedicated so much of their lives in so many ways to ensuring that those who died on the 14th June 2017 will always be remembered. To them I say once again that the truth will out. That justice will be done. And that Grenfell Tower and the people who called it home will never be forgotten."
"Boris Johnson","PM statement at NATO meeting: 4 December 2019","4 December 2019","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-statement-at-nato-meeting-4-december-2019","It was agreed amongst all of us that 70 years after its foundation here in London, it is absolutely true to say that NATO is the most successful alliance in history and it now guarantees the peace and prosperity of a billion people around the world in 29 countries. It will shortly be 30 of course, now that North Macedonia is joining. And everybody also attested to the fundamental reason for the success of that alliance and it is based on the idea of solidarity, in defence of our values of freedom and democracy, the basic idea of all for one and one for all encapsulated in Article 5 of the North Atlantic treaty that we come to each other’s mutual defence. That’s why NATO works and that’s why it’s so powerful and so successful. And of course the UK has long argued that you can’t be complacent about that, you can’t remotely take that for granted, you’ve got to ensure that we continue to spend on our collective defence and that’s why we’ve made the case for 2% of GDP as the minimum NATO spend for every member. And we’ve been successful in that campaign, because if you look at what’s happened since the Cardiff summit in 2014, actually there has been a substantial increase in spending by our European friends of $130 billion dollars - it will rise to $400 billion by 2024. And at this meeting here today and country after country pledged or gave an account of how they were going to meet the pledge of 2%. I was able to sketch out some of the ways which the UK leads in for instance the European contribution to the NATO readiness initiative and we are contributing one armed brigade, two squadrons of fast jets, six major warships - including the two aircraft carriers. And several other delegations, several other nations, also emphasised that were going to step up their contributions to the readiness initiative amongst other things. And there was a mood of very great solidarity and determination and a willingness to push NATO forward, not just for the next few years but for the next 70 years. A real belief in the long-standing value of this alliance. And we also had good discussions on Russia, how we should respond collectively to Russia, the need to be aware of Russia but also the need to engage. We discussed cyber, the challenges of what is going on in cyberspace, the asymmetric warfare and threats that we collectively face, the need for us to engage together in looking at the challenges from space and working together to develop a policy on space. We also agreed that we would, having heard a really terrible account of the earthquake in Tirana in Albania from Edi Rama, we also agreed that we would act collectively to help the people of Tirana and Durres to get back on their feet. And that was the essence of the discussion that I think was extremely practical and extremely harmonious."

Because of course in the next few days everybody in our country is going to spend Christmas with their families, and you are going to be here. A long way away, in a pretty cold place, at Christmas, in the Baltic States in Estonia. And what you are doing is incredibly important because the reason everybody in our country can have Christmas in peace and security is because of what you are doing here. Quite literally what you are doing is showing that NATO works, and that NATO is an alliance to which we in this country are absolutely committed. And the idea of NATO is very, very simple. It’s all for one and one for all. And that means that when our Estonian friends want a commitment by the British Army we make that commitment with this Enhanced Forward Presence. And they love it. It does fantastic things for the local community and I talked earlier on to Prime Minister Jüri Ratas and he says that the contribution of British troops is fantastic and all the engagement with the local population is wonderful. But it’s about much more than that. It’s a demonstration by our country that we are committed to the security and stability of the whole of Europe, and you are the most vivid and powerful possible symbol and expression of that support and commitment. And that is why one billion people are protected by the NATO alliance. The most successful military alliance in history. And that is why we have peace and security and stability in Europe, and peace and stability in Europe for seventy years. And it is an incredible thing for me to come to Estonia and think that when I was a kid, when I was your age actually, Estonia was part of the Soviet Union and we are now here helping to protect Estonia and to guarantee its security. It is a fantastic thing, it is a deeply moving thing for someone of my generation. Thank you all very much for what you are doing. Happy Christmas."

It’s that special time of year when, whatever has gone before, we can take an opportunity to celebrate all that is good in the world and to spend time with our friends and family. Christmas Day is, first and foremost, a celebration of the birth of Jesus Christ. It is a day of inestimable importance to billions of Christians the world over. I hope you are all enjoying a wonderful break with your loved ones, sharing gifts and tucking into some delicious food. Of course, as many of us are enjoying a break at this time of year, let’s not forget all those who have selflessly put their celebrations on hold. On behalf of the whole country I want to say a huge thank you to our amazing NHS staff, many of whom will be working throughout the holidays to take care of us. Thank you also to our police, and all those public servants working tirelessly this Christmas. I also want to express my personal gratitude to the wonderful members of our Armed Forces currently on deployment – and therefore to their friends, family and children back home who will have an empty chair at the table when they tuck in to their Christmas dinner. Today of all days, I want us to remember those Christians around the world who are facing persecution. For them, Christmas Day will be marked in private, in secret, perhaps even in a prison cell. As Prime Minister, that’s something I want to change. We stand with Christians everywhere, in solidarity, and will defend your right to practice your faith. So as a country let us reflect on the year, and celebrate the good that is to come. Folks, I hope you enjoy the next few days. Try not to have too many arguments with the in-laws, or anyone else. And whoever you are, wherever you are, and however you’re celebrating, have a very happy Christmas, and I’ll see you all again in the New Year."

"Boris Johnson","A UK-Ghana partnership Beyond Aid: op-ed by Iain Walker","16 January 2020","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/a-uk-ghana-partnership-beyond-aid-op-ed-by-iain-walker","When it comes to building a more prosperous future, the UK-Ghana partnership is driving the agenda at the UK-Africa Investment Summit. Ghana is changing the narrative around the future of the African continent. Last year, the nation captured international headlines and energised the global African Diaspora through the ‘Year of Return’. I am delighted that thousands came from the UK to be a part of the campaign; tourism from the UK was up 24%. The presence of so many Brit-Ghanaian influencers has fostered even stronger ties with Ghana. Brit-Ghanaians were front and centre at the major music festivals that took place in Accra over Christmas. The real story of Ghana is out there - one of aspiration, ambition and energy, and a journey to greater economic self-reliance. The UK Government shares His Excellency President Akufo-Addo’s ‘Beyond Aid’ vision for Africa. The Continent has 8 of the 15 fastest growing economies in the world but currently receives less than 4% of foreign direct investment. It is in all our interests to change this paradigm. A major milestone Today, Prime Minister Boris Johnson hosts the UK-Africa Investment Summit in London. The Summit brings together UK and African businesses, African leaders, international institutions and young entrepreneurs. It is the platform for creating new partnerships to deliver more investment, jobs and growth to benefit people across Africa and the UK. Ghana is driving the agenda for how Africa can meet its needs and ambitions: locating the Africa Continental Free Trade Area Secretariat in Accra is recognition of Ghanaian leadership. When they meet in London, His Excellency The President and the Prime Minister will discuss the future of the UK-Ghana prosperity partnership that is accelerating ‘Ghana Beyond Aid’, with economic development, investment and jobs at its core. Our 0.7% of GNI (Gross National Income) spend on development is smarter than ever. A new Agricultural Transformation Programme will develop new agriculture markets and climate resilience; our Jobs & Economic Transformation Programme is attracting investment and creating jobs in key industrial sectors; and new programmes are supporting urban infrastructure development, deepening financial markets, improving land governance and helping women entrepreneurs. A UK-Ghana partnership focused on action H.E. Nana Akufo Addo, President of Ghana shaking hands with British PM Boris Johnson. Our deeds matter more than our words. We have applied this principle to the creation of the UK-Ghana Business Council (UKGBC), an economic forum co-chaired by His Excellency The Vice President Alhaji Dr Mahamudu Bawumia and UK Ministers. The UKGBC is driving the partnership around 6 priority sectors (financial services, agro-processing, extractives, garments, digital and pharmaceuticals) bringing a clear focus to the partnership and shaping an integrated offer that brings together UK firms, capital and expertise. Global finance, through The City of London, is crowding in more investment and supporting innovation, such as the first London-listed ‘Cedi Bond’. The creation of a new partnership between the London Stock Exchange and the Ghana Stock Exchange will support Ghana’s ambition to secure ‘emerging market’ status and become a hub for financial services. Bilateral trade is worth £1.3 billion, up 21% on last year. Significantly, we are seeing Ghana export more goods and services to the UK (up 55%) – a positive sign of Ghana’s economic transformation and export-orientated growth. UK firms are taking notice, and we are backing them through $1billion of credit guarantees from UK Export Finance. I’m delighted that this facility is fully utilised in Ghana, including: $400 million for the Offshore Cape Three Points project by GE Oil and Gas UK; and recently the expansion of Kumasi Airport and upgrading Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital by Contracta UK. There are many exciting UK-led projects on the horizon, including Africa’s first green loan to Aqua Africa to bring UK-designed technology to deliver clean drinking water; and work by Ordnance Survey to create a full-scale digital map of Ghana, and digitalise the land registry system. Beyond the European Union Our trading relationship is even more important as we look beyond the European Union and finalise the EU Withdrawal Agreement on 31 January. I am pleased that we can continue to apply the same trading arrangements with Ghana for the duration of the Implementation Period, i.e. until 31 December 2020. Before then, we must further trade policy discussions to ensure we maintain Ghana’s duty-free and quota-free access to the UK in 2021 and beyond. This will protect Ghanaian jobs and support foreign investment. I am confident about the future of the UK-Ghana relationship and of our ambition to become the investment partner of choice for Africa. Whichever way you look at it, Ghana is at the centre of the development of the African Continent, and the UK-Ghana partnership offers a blueprint. The UK-Africa Investment Summit is the next big step forward on that journey."
"Boris Johnson","Minister for Africa's speech at UN Global Compact event","17 January 2020","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/minister-of-state-speech-at-un-global-compact-event","Well thank you for that kind introduction, if you don’t mind, I will stand up because I just always find it’s easier to speak while standing. It’s a great pleasure to be able to join you and can I start by thanking Flora [Ms Flor Mutahi, founder and CEP of Melvin Marsh International and Chair of the Anti-Counterfeit Authority for the Government of Kenya] for her words, which I think were very salient. As was said in the introduction, before joining the Foreign Office and the Department for International Development, I was a business minister, and before entering our parliament I ran my own business in Manchester. So, I really do get the importance of the private sector and not just in the United Kingdom, but globally as a force for good in the world. And you know, I’ve always been one of those people who believes in government, but particularly I have always been somebody who’s believed that the better route out of poverty is work. And when we look at the young, growing population we have right across the continent of Africa, the best thing we can do in order to help people, is to help them by economic prosperity, put them into work and help create the jobs, that millions of young Africans entering the labour market will require to get on in life. So there is a lot of work for us to do. Very proud to now be a member of our Department of International Development and the Foreign Office. It is a joint ministerial role and it hopefully brings together different aspects of the British Government, of our commitment to spend 0.7% of our Gross National Income on development work which leads to spending fourteen and a half billion pounds in global efforts. There has been a shift in our work. Three years ago we really shifted the focus onto economic empowerment, and working obviously the SDGs [Sustainable Development Goals] are at the absolute centre of everything we do, but we recognise that we have to harness the power of the private sector. And we have to work with economies around the world, in order to create that wealth and create those jobs. So there has been a shift in what we do; in the Department for International Development; that sort of thing that chimes very much with what we are discussing tonight, that is something I very much want to expand on as my role as a minister. So of course, we are meeting here tonight ahead of the Africa Investment summit on Monday. Which will be a key moment for the United Kingdom to bring government, delegations from 21 different countries, bring those delegates and British businesses and international businesses and international organisation, bring everybody together. Over 2000 delegates will be meeting on Monday. And hopefully that will provide a huge forum, a huge platform, for us to showcase some of the investment opportunities in Africa and to make people look again at Africa as a place to really invest. I think this Summit could not be coming at a more pivotal time, we have entered the decade of delivery to meet the Global Goals and the only way that we can do that, it is not just down to government, it is down to working with the private sector and harnessing the power of the private sector. The African Continental Free Trade Agreement, which was mentioned, provides an opportunity to catalyse trade and foreign direct investment flows into Africa. And this will help fill gab, financing gap, for achieving Global Goals on the Continent, which of course is estimated at being up to $1.2 trillion. The UK is committed to working with business and investors to increase their impact on the Global Goals. We have been supporting the UN Global Compact since 2014. As the world’s largest corporate sustainability initiative, we recognise that the UNGC is a key engine for driving change in business behaviour. And I am proud of the work the UNGC does and has already achieved. To have more than 10,000 member companies in over 160 countries representing nearly every sector and size is a truly fantastic achievement. An achievement that I am proud to say DFID, the Department for International Development, is playing our part in – as all DFID suppliers are required to be members of the UNGC. As we enter the UN Global Compact’s 20th Anniversary year, the revamped UN Global Compact Africa Strategy aims to expand the organisation’s work in Africa and mobilise a greater movement of responsible businesses to help advance the continent’s sustainability agenda and national development goals. We are pleased to be part of this journey and look forward to seeing the UN Global Compact expanding in Africa. Our partnership with the UNGC is part of my Department’s broader Economic Development Strategy. Launched three years ago, the strategy commits the UK government to support the creation of decent jobs, providing more economic opportunities particularly for women, and ensuring nobody is left behind. The Summit on Monday is key to delivering this strategy, bringing together government delegations, investors and businesses to create new lasting partnerships that will deliver more investment, more jobs and more growth, which will benefit people and businesses across Africa and here in the United Kingdom. You will hear more about our efforts to meet Africa’s potential and partnerships from Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Monday when he is at the Summit. We all know that Africa has great economic potential. The IMF estimates that Africa is home to eight of the world’s 15 fastest growing economies. As we leave the European Union and we honour that pledge that we made to the British people, we want a closer partnership with African nations, and we are helping UK businesses to seize new and exciting opportunities for investment across the continent. By 2050, over 2 billion people will live in Africa and 1 in 4 global consumers will be African. Currently, African countries receive less than 4% of foreign direct investment and around 20 million jobs a year must be created to keep pace with that population growth. That is why I want to create mutually beneficial partnerships for the future and help Africa move beyond aid, to trade. We can, all of us around this table, we can all play our part in tackling the Global challenges and eliminating extreme poverty around the world. We can create new opportunities for ourselves and the generations to come. We can, and we must."
"Boris Johnson","PM Africa Investment Summit speech: 20 January 2020","20 January 2020","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-africa-investment-summit-speech-20-january-2020","Good morning. Heads of state, heads of government. Business leaders. Friends. Good morning to you all and a very warm welcome to London, to the UK, and to a new start in our business partnership between my country and your countries and indeed the whole continent of Africa. I am reliably informed that this is the very first time that the UK and quite so many African nations have come together for an event of this kind. And when we celebrate all sorts of exciting new beginnings, the start of a new year, a new decade, a new government here in Britain, it is an event whose time has come. And indeed an event that is long overdue. An event that I regard as the climax of considerable personal exertion because during my two years as foreign secretary I visited more African nations than any other senior British politician in living memory Ghana, the Gambia, Libya, Liberia, Uganda, Nigeria, Cote D’Ivoire, Somalia, Kenya, Egypt, Ethiopia - where in a fit of brilliance our excellent ambassador decided that I should challenge Haile Gebrselaissie to a running race in Addis Abba at an altitude of 2355 m, and in fierce sunshine, over a distance of about a mile. And I had to pretend to have a heart attack in order to get him to slow down and what everybody said was that it was a very convincing impersonation of a man having a heart attack. And wherever I was I am proud to say I found a lot of interest and lot of affection for the UK and even a lot of love. But I also realised that we in the UK have a vital job in continuing to convince people across the continent that we’re not just a great friend and ally, a reliable ally, but also the people you should be doing business with. We have no divine right to that business. This is a competitive world. You have many suitors. Some of you may be off shortly to sample the delights of Davos. But look today at what we have to offer, look around the world today and you will swiftly see that the UK is not only the obvious partner of choice. We also are very much the partner of today, of tomorrow and decades to come. Because the truth is, in 2020 the UK is the ultimate one-stop shop for the ambitious, growing international economy. If you want investment in a new project or enterprise just hop on the tube and one stop from here you’ll be in the heart of Canary Wharf, where, along with its older sibling in the City of London, trillions of pounds of capital are being raised for every venture you can think of from French construction to African telecoms to American cancer curing drugs. In every currency you have heard of and some that have only been recently invented and it may give you some idea of the scale of the financial services in London when I say that Canary Wharf alone is a bigger banking centre than the whole of Frankfurt. We have the tech. We have ed tech, med tech, fin tech, bio tech, green tech, nano tech. Tech of all kinds. And we have by far the biggest tech sector anywhere in this hemisphere, two or three times bigger than our rivals, and that works in synergy of course with our amazing higher education sector. We have more of the world’s top universities than any other country outside the US. Every year, thanks to our Chevening and Commonwealth Scholarships, their doors are opened to the best and brightest students from every part of Africa. And I am proud to say today that one in seven of the world’s Kings, Queens, Presidents, Prime Ministers were educated in this country including the Japanese emperor. We have a total global monopoly on the higher education of emperors. Thank you – it’s true. And if you want to come here to study in those universities, if you want to play a part in the hi-tech revolution, if you want to work with the titans of our financial world, then you’ll be pleased to hear, my friends, that one thing is changing. Our immigration system. I know it’s an issue that people have raised with me in the past but change is coming. And our system is becoming fairer and more equal as between all our global friends and partners. Treating people the same regardless, wherever they come from and by putting people before passports, we will be able to attract the best talent from around the world, wherever they may be. Because I appreciate, as I say, that there is no shortage of governments out there touting for your business. China, I must mention the competition, I better I mean why not, China, Russia, Germany. I’m told there will be a conference in France fairly soon. But in the words of an old Akan proverb that I picked up while I was in Ghana, “All fingers are not the same.” There is wisdom in these Akan proverbs. All fingers are not the same and all countries are not the same, and the UK boasts a breadth and depth of expertise that simply cannot be matched by any other nation. And that’s why we are already one of the biggest partners for countries across Africa. Look at the billions of pounds worth of deals that are being finalised just here today and that we are announcing. The monorail trains. The monorail trains that will shortly be conveying citizens through the streets of Cairo, that great and growing city, will be made here. The monorail trains will be made here in the UK in Derby. In Nigeria’s Oyo state every street light is being installed with low carbon high efficiency low emission diodes from Dorset. I had no idea they made these things in Dorset. There you go. Families across Angola will shortly be tucking into delicious wholesome chicken from Northern Ireland. Thousands of tonnes, millions of birds, for millions of years the birds of this country have flown south to Africa for the winter. But it is thanks to the miracle of free trade that today our birds go plucked, frozen, oven ready. And at the same time of course, and I think Uhuru Kenyatta asked me this question, the BA planes coming the other way are sometimes quite chilly. A point that the President of Kenya raised with me and I made representations on his behalf. And one of the reasons may be is that the holds of those planes are full each of them with 13 tonnes of sliced and refrigerated fruit coming to the supermarkets of the UK. And of course we want to build a new future as a global free trading nation, that’s what we are doing now and that’s what we will be embarking on, on the 31st January this month. But I want to intensify and expand that trade in ways that go far beyond what we sell you or you sell us. We want to go far beyond though I have just told President Museveni of Uganda that his beef cattle will have an honoured place on the tables of post Brexit Britain. Yes, he’s very proud of them and quite rightly. But I want to go beyond that. Because what I am really talking about is building a partnership that benefits all of us. And it’s about synergies and partnerships and it means things like Diageo spending $167 million to make its east African breweries as clean, efficient and sustainable as possible through biomass, solar power, water recovery and purification. And it means encouraging people like Lolade Oresanwo. Born in Nigeria, Lolade came to the UK to study at one of our many world-leading higher education institutions. So armed with an MBA she headed back to Lagos and, in 2014, helped set up what is now the region’s biggest waste-processing operation, West Africa ENRG. Every day, every day, yes let’s hear it for Lolade, everyday her team scoop up 2,000 tonnes of rubbish destined for landfill. They sift out the stuff that can be recycled and then – very soon – they’re going to start using the rest to generate clean electricity for schools and hospitals. And the whole thing is run using mostly British-made equipment, because, even if I say it myself, it’s the best in the world, and it’s backed by UK investors, with ongoing research and development support from Lolade’s alma mater, Cranfield University. So Lolade and her team make the local streets cleaner and the global environment greener. They have created 3,000 jobs in Nigeria, the vast majority of them for women. They help keep the order books full for British manufacturers. And the whole operation provides a tidy return for investors both in Nigeria and in the UK. It is a great example of what the modern UK/Africa partnership looks like. An exchange of ideas, equipment and finance to solve common problems. A relationship that benefits us all and makes a lasting, difference. And the same is true of the UK government’s $53 million investment at the Port in Mombasa. A serious, commercially minded development like many other overseas investments in Africa. But rather than being arranged on extraordinarily one-sided terms and delivered by a vast imported workforce, without wishing to cast aspersions on any other potential partner, it was a sustainable deal that created jobs for ordinary Kenyans now and in the future. And it was made all the easier for British businesses to work with and trade with their Kenyan counterparts and vice-versa. I’m told that probably partly as a result of what is going on in Mombasa half of all the tea drunk in the UK comes to us from Kenya. Think of that. Britain without a nice cup of tea is barely worth thinking about, and that means Britain without Kenya is barely worth thinking about. Literally sustained, kept sane and rational throughout the day by infusions of Kenyan supply tea. Even if it doesn’t originate in Kenya it comes through Kenya, you’ve got to be careful about that. And it is the sustainable, forward-thinking nature of that investment in Mombasa that marks us out, I would say, as different from the global crowd. And that kind of sustainable thinking applies to our shared environment every bit as much as it does to our common business interests. Climate change and loss of biodiversity are issues that affect us all. I know that many of your countries are already on the front line in the fight against both and I look forward to seeing many of you again when the UK hosts COP26 in Glasgow later this year. And of course one of the many reasons we were chosen to host COP26 was the incredible speed with which we have cleaned up our domestic energy industry. A decade ago we were the most carbon heavy nation in Europe - one of the most carbon-heavy nations in Europe. Today, we are a world-leader in offshore wind. We regularly generate more of our electricity from renewables than from fossil fuels, regularly. And we have almost entirely weaned ourselves off coal. But there’s no point in the UK reducing the amount of coal we burn if we then trundle over to Africa and line our pockets by encouraging African states to use more of it. Is there? We all breathe the same air, we live beneath the same sky, and we all suffer when carbon emissions rise and the planet warms. So from today, the British government will no longer provide any new direct official development assistance, investment, export credit or trade promotion for thermal coal mining or coal power plants overseas. To put it simply, not another penny of UK taxpayers’ money will be directly invested in digging up coal or burning it for electricity. Instead, we’re going to focus on supporting the transition to lower- and zero-carbon alternatives. First, by helping you to extract and use oil and gas in the cleanest, greenest way possible. We are world-leaders in that and have much to share. But also by turbocharging, if turbo-charging is a word I can use in the context of low-carbon energy technology, our support for solar, and wind and hydro and all the other carbon-free sources of energy that surround us, and are just waiting to be harnessed. If I can’t say turbo charging, what can I say, we’re going to deliver an electro convulsive lightning bolt through our renewables industry. That process is already underway, because a whole host of British companies are already working with national governments across Africa and around the world to increase renewable capacity. There’s a huge myth about this, people say that you have to choose between reducing emissions and raising economic growth. Look at what happened here in the UK. Actually we have cut CO2 by 42 per cent since 1990 and yet GDP has gone up 67 per cent. And we stand ready to help you do the same. Tackling the causes of climate change, while also delivering the power needed to unlock the potential of all our people. And what an incredible potential that is. Africa is a continent of amazing, independent and diverse nations. But they – you - have some things in common clearly. Some of you are members of the Commonwealth - 19 members of the Commonwealth – look forward to the summit in Kigali. But one thing that unites African countries is ambition, and optimism and, by comparison with much of the rest of the world, quite staggering levels of growth. More than half the world’s fastest, 15 fastest growing economies are in Africa. Two-thirds of African economies are expanding faster than the global average. Africa is the future and the UK has a huge and active role to play in that future. And I hope you agree. Because we are, and we will be, a partner, your partner through thick and thin. Our universities are helping to educate the next generation of African entrepreneurs. By helping to provide securities, I’ve seen myself, in Somalia, South Sudan, the Sahel and beyond. Our businesses, our investors, our entrepreneurs, our mind-bogglingly innovative financial services sector are helping Africans from Casablanca to Cape Town to face the future with confidence. Today, here in London, here in this fantastic hotel, which I think I gave planning permission for. In the days when I was - a lot of the stuff you see around I helped to build I am proud to say. This fantastic city. We are bringing together leaders of nations and businesses, and I hope that this meeting will serve as a great cyclotron of talent in which ideas and people will come together and spark some flash of creativity. And, at the start of this new decade, we, the UK and your nations, are taking the first steps on the road to a new partnership between all our people. And like, whatever the apparent differences in our skill sets and our abilities and the complementarity, like me and Haile Gebreselaissie thundering round Addis Ababa, we want to be with you, side by side, every step of the way. So let’s seize the opportunities that are before us here today. Let’s build the partnerships for the future. And, together, let us begin to write the next chapter for my country, for your country, and above all for all the peoples of our countries. Thank you all for very much for coming and welcome to London."
"Boris Johnson","Alok Sharma's closing speech at UK-Africa Investment Summit","20 January 2020","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/alok-sharmas-closing-speech-at-uk-africa-investment-summit","Let me extend my thanks to all of you for making the UK’s first Africa Investment Summit such a success. Certainly for me and all my colleagues in government, this has been a fabulous day. I started off with President Kenyatta at the London Stock Exchange. This was absolutely a landmark moment for Kenya’s capital markets. And now I close this Summit addressing you this afternoon. We have representatives from 21 African countries and the UK government and British business deeply appreciates the effort that you have all made to join us today. I am very grateful to Nobukhosi Dlamini, Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, and all our speakers, and also to Lucy Quist, our other moderators, and all participants. Before I address what’s actually been achieved today, let’s look at what we hope will be the legacy of those achievements, lets remind ourselves of why we came together today. I personally am absolutely delighted that Africa is the focus of our first international summit as a new Government. In a rapidly changing world, it is Africa that has the biggest potential. Of that, there is absolutely no doubt. It is home to eight of the 15 fastest growing economies, 60 per cent of the population is under the age of 25. One way to look at it, Africa may historically be the oldest continent but right now in the 21st century it is the youngest continent on Earth. As Africa grows and develops, international partnerships and investment will be key to unleashing that potential and delivering a better future for all those young people. That is why we have held the UK-Africa Investment Summit. We want the UK to be the investment partner of choice for Africa. I would like you to go back to this morning and reflect on the African proverb that Prime Minister Boris Johnson quoted about the size of fingers. That I thought was very illuminating. Of course, our ambition is reflected in the energy of this summit. We have heard from Heads of State and Governments, as well as young entrepreneurs, tech experts and business leaders. And it is clear that everyone shares that ambition. We started the day with £6.5 billion of deals and have ended with billions more. That is thanks to people in this room. The UK Government has announced over £1.5 billion of new initiatives. We expect these to create hundreds of thousands of jobs. And mobilise over £2.4 billion of private investment for African countries, something that every speaker has said we need more of. Of course this is just a small part of what the UK can offer Africa. We have world-leading technology and innovation expertise. We are committed to green growth that will help protect our environment for future generations. And we are global leaders on driving economic development through UK aid. Something that I see every say in my working life. While driving much-needed private finance into Africa, we want to see investment that builds self-sustaining economies. Economies that can provide quality health and education for everyone. And investments that properly consider their impact on the environment. The City of London is the global gateway to sustainable international investment for Africa. London is the biggest centre for foreign exchange trading; and the largest for cross-border banking, As well as being home to major investors, innovators and multinational businesses. More and more of those investors are recognising Africa’s potential. What makes the UK different is our recognition that this huge investment needs to be felt by local communities across the whole of Africa. Everyone must share in prosperity. CDC, our own Development Finance Institution, is investing right across the continent. Making pioneering investments; backing first-time funds; and helping to mobilise other private investors. Today CDC has agreed new investments worth £300m and are committed to invest a further £2bn in Africa over the next two years. I have announced £320m to help improve the financial systems and regulations of 45 developing nations in Africa. We are not just boosting investor confidence, but also opening up access to banking and lending services for millions of entrepreneurs right across Africa. With investment comes trade. As we get Brexit done, we want a closer trading partnership with African nations. We have already signed trade agreements with 11 African countries, covering over 40 per cent of the UK’s total trade with Africa. We have seven more in the pipeline. And we have secured trade continuity for a further 35 countries. This means businesses from these countries can continue to export to the UK on a preferential basis. We want UK businesses to seize new exciting opportunities for investment across Africa. As we have heard today by 2050, more than two billion people will live in Africa. One in four global consumers will be African. That is untapped potential. Potential for business to create jobs and investment across Africa. We are providing direct support and advice to African businesses to help them make the most of UK markets. While also supporting UK firms to source more quality, competitively-priced products from Africa. Many UK businesses are already benefitting from these opportunities, and are here today. I also saw this first-hand on a recent visit to Kenya Cambridge-based business called Azuri Technologies which provides solar energy systems to off-grid homes across Africa. Africa offers a wealth of young talent, where the majority of entrepreneurs are women. Nobukhosi and others have demonstrated the vision shown by Africa’s future female business leaders. It is why we have emphasised the importance of increasing support to help more women and girls in Africa. A big priority for Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Allowing women and girls to move successfully from education into employment, through training, boosting skills, and more job opportunities. To realise Africa’s full potential the entire population must be empowered. We all know that Africa’s future is bright. We know that there are deals to be done, and that investment can have a transformative effect on all our countries. But we must be realistic about the scale of the challenge. Accomplishing the UN’s Global Goals for a healthier, wealthier, more equal, and greener world by 2030 will require an immense amount of work and crucially more private investment. The huge burden of Climate Change will not be shared equally or fairly across the world. Many developing countries are already bearing the brunt of its impact. Future growth must be sustainable. It needs to consider the undeniable implications of climate change. That is why the Prime Minister today announced that the UK will no longer provide any direct investment or assistance to thermal coal mining and power plants overseas. We have seen at this summit the commercial potential for clean energy, alongside the appetite from investors to power growth in Africa. We must harness that potential. Earlier today the Prime Minister passionately made the case for Global Britain to be the investment partner of choice for Africa. The whole UK government is devoted to this agenda. We are opening new embassies and High Commissions in Africa, We are signing trade agreements that continue the open trading relationships we all enjoy. And we are helping UK companies and investors do business in Africa. But let us remember – we each have a role to play. Government cannot deliver prosperity alone. It is business that strikes the biggest deals. Which is why it is great to see so many of you in this room. It is the partnerships and friendships we are creating here today that will have the biggest impact. The UK is entering this decade with a new sense of purpose. We are open for business. and open to creating lasting partnerships that deliver more investment, more jobs, and growth for all our countries. Mutual partnerships will bring mutual benefits. From the workers whose jobs are created by businesses, to the young entrepreneurs with the ideas that can help solve today’s problems. Our overarching mission is to bring universal prosperity, health, and economic sustainability, to all our countries. If we continue this co-operation and friendship, we can do it. Ladies and gentlemen, Africa has a special place in my heart. When I was a child my father worked in Nigeria and I loved my time there and I can tell you that I learnt to ride my bicycle in Nigeria, and I haven’t forgotten that yet. But let me conclude by saying that the 21 countries represented here today account for over 80 per cent of Africa’s economy. When you succeed, the whole of Africa succeeds. And when Africa succeeds, the world succeeds. Let’s work together, for mutual success. Thank you."
"Boris Johnson","Governor Dakin's speech at Turks & Caicos Islands National Security Strategy launch","22 January 2020","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/governor-dakins-speech-at-tci-national-security-strategy-launch-22-january-2020","TCI now, for the first time, has a National Security Strategy. The need for TCI to have this was driven by the Premier and it became one of my first priorities, on arrival, to help her deliver it. It sat very well with my own initial priorities, outlined in my inauguration speech, around crime, illegal immigration and hurricane preparedness. The most important line in the strategy we launch today is the last sentence of the introduction “In terms of the leadership needed to tackle National Security challenges the Premier’s and the Governor’s Office stand together”. When it comes to the specifics of crime and policing, because national security is much more than crime, we also bring the Commissioner into this top team. In these three roles we combine all the powers we need: funding through taxing and spending; democratic accountability; decisions around operational deployment; executive and emergency powers if needed; and the ability to reach beyond our own borders. If we were pulling against each other, or even working in parallel rather than together, none of us could deliver in the way the country rightly demands. But that’s explicitly not the case. All that I’m about to say would not have been possible without the Strategy we launch today – and the thinking that went onto it. The institutions that flow from it, help consolidate this ‘top team relationship’ so it’s not personality dependent, but the way Government functions in the future to look after the safety and security of its people. With one team at the top, we intend to create a ‘one government team’ around us to deal with these issues. The team you see with us today are among the top thirty officials in TCI Government and Policing that will execute the strategy. We are also grateful to be joined – as not disinterested observers - by the Commissioner of Montserrat, the Deputy Commissioner from Cayman and the Assistant Commissioner from Bermuda. We are strengthened by your presence Gentlemen. All of us are presently involved in a one week training exercise run by the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst but we have taken an hour out of that course to be with you today. We are in a classroom learning - you are never too old to learn – and in learning, as much from each other - we are coming together as a team, sharing experiences, forming, storming and norming around one shared endeavour: to make this country safer. All in this room agree that the fact this country is small should be our strength in terms of national security. Our communication and co-operation across Government should be straightforward. We should be agile. We should be efficient. But let’s be frank with each other, we are presently none of these things – so this week is important, indeed vital, in that process of change. A public version of the strategy will be published but I suspect the public are interested today, not in what’s written on paper, but what’s happening as a result of the Strategy in the real world. That’s what I intend to focus on. First, once you have the right strategy, you then need the right structures and the people with the right skills to implement it. So that’s where I start: an already established National Security Council has been reimagined that can develop national capability and work at the strategic level and tackle wicked problems. That change has now occurred we are feeling the benefits. Bringing experts into the room, as required, has helped since September a UK funded security advisor has been in place to help drive strategic change. The Premier and myself, and I suspect all who have come into contact with her, want to pay public tribute to Victoria for her detailed planning work. Much of what I’m about to describe, she has been instrumental in I can announce today that a TCIG National Security Advisor (modelled on the role of the NSA in the UK) has been appointed who will work to both the Governor and Premier. This is a significant step forward in both tying together Government but also vesting more responsibility in Turks Islanders to manage national security. This will be Tito Lightbourne who will become the first Permanent Secretary National Security. This role will allow him to work across Government Departments with the authority of the Governor and Premier and he will co-ordinate to ensure proper cross-government working on National Security issues while being the focus for building long term national security capability. at the same time I can announce the promotion and appointment of two new Permanent Secretaries into the key Ministries involved in National Security. Mr Desmond Wilson will take over as PS Border Control and brings considerable experience with him as the former Director of Immigration. He also has a well-deserved reputation for action and delivery; qualities I admire Ms Althea Been who moves from being a Deputy Secretary in Border Control, and will therefore be taking useful context about the challenges of that area of national security, will start as PS at Home Affairs on the 1st April. She also has a reputation for proactivity and delivery and that reassures us that she will be a first class member of the top team vital, for example, in redeveloping the Prison and all matters linked to that institution funding of a National Security Secretariat, working to Tito Lightbourne has been agreed. The threats outlined in the Strategy will be managed by two senior ‘Threat Leads’ in the Secretariat; crucially that includes our resilience to, and recovery from, disasters. Placing that issue in the centre of Government, rather than on the side, is an important shift of emphasis when we combine this NSA and Secretariat with the strong command and control function the Police have now developed at the operational level we will have a well-drilled national command structure for use in times of crisis at the strategic, operational and tactical levels. We will be rehearsing and refining this capability during the year in terms of new and significant national capability we are in close touch with the UK Ministry of Defence, as you know we intend to generate a Turks and Caicos Regiment – our own Defence Force. We expect to be asking for expressions of interest for the Regiment’s first Commanding Officer within weeks, followed by advertising for its regular Officer cadre shortly thereafter, before starting to recruit the ‘Reserve Force’ in the summer Looking further down into the strategy, I intend to use my remaining time today, to look at the two issues that are at the top of the public’s agenda: Illegal Immigration and separately, because it’s intellectually lazy to conflate the two, Serious Crime But before I do that I want to emphasise that the most pressing threat to our National Security – over a period of decades – is going to be natural disaster. The seas around us are warming. They provide the fuel for hurricanes, and we are in their path. You’ll see in the strategy it’s in the top two we must tackle – we have to move from a position where we focus on ‘recovery’ to one where much more effort is placed on ‘resilience’. Countries in the Caribbean that don’t, will go into perpetual decline, unable to recover properly between each natural disaster. Worth also putting on record that, other than Natural Disaster, Illegal Immigration and Serious Crime, the other six issues the Strategy calls out as threats are: critical national infrastructure failure; serious public disorder; maritime sovereignty; food security and scarcity; cyber and, finally; terrorism, money laundering and financing of terrorism. Before moving onto crime let me start with what we are doing to reverse the seriously destabilising impact illegal immigration has on our society. without getting ahead of ourselves we now have the start of a good story to tell in terms of the interdiction of the traditional large sloops. I said shortly after my arrival in July that I intended to learn from failure and be accountable. We’ve studied trends, both success and failures. While ten landed in the first half of the year, from 30th August, only one large vessel has got through – and even then a number, although not all, of its illegal passengers were arrested once they made land fall the team we have on the front line protecting our maritime borders – led by Ennis Grant, Everet Warrican, Tito Forbes and Rodman Johnson are, to my mind, heroic. As a team we’ve been testing, adjusting and learning. Staffing at the radar has been increased, more efficient deployment of Maritime assets has been established and better cross-government working introduced there’s much more to do and a virtual team that pulls together the Maritime Branch, Radar and Immigration Task Force has started to take root. Linking them to the US Coastguard and Bahamian Defence Force in a wider international team, a game changer. And at this point I pay great tribute to our international partners. This is essential because we cannot be complacent: as we improve so do our opponents – Darwinian like – they evolve. We have to adapt our ways of working and capabilities rapidly; we are now starting to have the team work in place to make that happen. but stopping the sloops is attacking the symptom not the cause. The big change the Strategy calls out is the need to go after the under-pinning business model: prosecuting those, in TCI, and overseas if we can reach them, profiting from this trade in human cargo. To that end a significant investigation into people trafficking – led by the Police and drawing on contracted UK Police Officers - has commenced. This large investigation is working in tandem with Canadian, US and UK law enforcement. The recent arrest of 29 Sri Lankans – and congratulations to all involved in that particular success - has allowed us to look through an investigative keyhole at a global people trafficking ring. With international partners we intend to exploit that opportunity with this ambition in mind – going after those profiting from the trade rather than just those trafficked - our intention is to build a secure and vetted capability on the Islands that can better collect, assess and then take action on intelligence we generate - or which is generated by our partners. Like the Defence Force, the UK are looking to support us in this and this will have strategic impact on all aspects of national security and serious crime significant funding from Government to upgrade the radar has also been secured. Our intention is to make detection so likely we disincentivise travel across dangerous waters. As it is, 15 Haitians lost their lives in the waters off West Caicos last year, we assume many more in open seas. We mourn their and their family’s loss while equally holding those who trafficked them, exploited them and profited from them, with contempt. They are now the targets of our criminal justice system very significantly – because great efficiency and effectiveness can be delivered if we get this right - programmatic work has begun to establish a Border Force probably with different combined land and combined sea elements. The Premier has been keen on this type of reorganisation from the beginning and she was right to be so funds have been secured to retrofit a seized fast vessel to strengthen the Maritime Branch that will be deployed on Grand Turk (seriously extending range) work has also begun with the US Coast Guard and the Bahamian Defence Force to significantly strengthen tri-lateral and bi-lateral co-operation. Lawyers are now involved in drafting future agreements. There has anyway been an immediate uptick in co-operation – some of that has been already described in the media - and we have been clear with all international parties that they shouldn’t underestimate TCI’s ambition. Our aim is to be a serious partner and player in the region in terms of energy we have initially focussed on stemming the maritime threat, so we are excited by the appointment of Desmond Wilson who, drawing on guidance from his Minister (who of course is part of the NSC) can use the convening power provided by the PS National Security and deliver a proportionate whole of Government approach, to tackling Illegal Immigration through arresting those who overstay, or who entered illegally. There’s a critical balance we must get right here in not alienating those who have every right to be here And now to crime: crime is rightly the hot topic so I will dwell on what, as Governor, Premier and Commissioner, we are doing to make a change. It’s important though to recognise that while the Police take the burden of public scrutiny, Policing on its own isn’t the answer. If you will indulge me to be clear, to the point of bluntness - the answer to the problem we are trying to solve won’t be reached until future public co-operation is in line with present public outrage policing by consent, which is our Policing model, can’t succeed without public trust and public engagement. Policing can do far better on this – and recognising this fact is an important first step - so we now have a structured approach to delivering that change. But the public must meet us half way and if they don’t, the investments we are making will fail. It’s that important. In some ways it’s that fragile an increase in overall Police numbers by 20% has begun, recruits have started training and the overall uplift will be complete by March 2021. The Commissioner tells us this increase will be a game changer; we can reinforce the very capable Tactical Unit, the Maritime Unit and crucially bring in proper Community Policing where the community gets to know their local officer through regular engagement we already have 8 officers training in Barbados. The recruitment of a further 20 – also recruited from inside TCI - has been completed on schedule and they will train in the Bahamas. Recruiting the next tranche of 20 is due to begin which will include bringing in experienced overseas officers who can immediately reinforce our Tactical and Maritime Unit. Further recruitment can be fine-tuned dependent on need as well as recruiting we must train existing staff – not least in terms of building a relationship with the public; our officers have been underinvested in for years. Funds for a significant uplift in Police Training have been agreed a gun crime unit has been established and this has started to yield results. More guns were recovered in the two months before Christmas than in the previous two years the use of a UK police officer, on island as part of the SIPT trial, but hugely experienced in murder investigations, has now been commissioned to review all murder cases. UK Police will review professional standards of conduct and performance in our Police force and separately review the structures and organisation of the Police’s approach to homicide and will then remain in country to mentor. The Commissioner has other initiatives he is working on drawing on UK policing experience that we are not yet in a positon to announce, but which will make an impact to the long term strength and health of the Force outside of the National Security Strategy, but crucial to its success, the last Chief Justice, independently, pulled together the Justice sector (Judges, Chief Magistrate, AG, DPP, Commissioner, Prison Superintendent, Social Welfare, UK Justice Advisor) into a committee that could drive positive change in the overall Justice system. Cabinet has now been presented with a plan as to how Government can support much needed change in all aspects of justice other than Policing. This includes the like of Prison reform, parole, rehabilitation, the efficiency of the system in delivering justice and the physical environment in which justice is delivered you will note from what I haven’t said – and this is explicit in the Strategy - that we stay top level and we deliberately do not seek to drop down into operational policing decisions around the deployment of officers and the like. It’s important that these decisions are the Commissioners, with his excellent Force Executive, so he can maintain operational independence. What the strategy seeks to do is give him the resources, connectivity to both other parts of Government and overseas, and the context in which the Force can succeed Conclusion I have spent previous press conferences expressing my heartfelt thoughts about the impact of crime. We rightly focus on murder but the truth is all crime corrodes our society and damages our people. Even new to these Islands I’d met the young man who had been simply introduced to me as ‘Spooky’, the DJ at the basketball games I attend. And I’d met a previous victim of murder, Jeffrey, and thought what a convivial and engaging bar tender he was and what a great young father he must be. This is a small society where murder feels close because it is close. Not only do families grieve, but with each murder the country grieves. The most important thing I can do to honour their short lives, the most important thing we can do in this room is recognise we all have personal agency in this endeavour. If you judge we are serious, the greatest thing you can do to honour those who have become victims is become equally serious yourself in playing your part. Many I know already feel this way. We need people actively building an ever healthier society, in whatever way they can, using whatever talent is at their disposal. I’m not going to appeal for information (others better placed than me can do that, although I’d note it’s the greatest contribution some could make) but I am – unapologetically - going to ask for national solidarity, for national unity, when it comes to national security. I’ve been particularly grateful to the Leader of the Opposition for his thoughtful, measured and constructive advice, to me personally and in a more formal consultation, as we have developed this. As a national leader, but also as an ex-Police Officer, his instincts have not only been important but genuinely valuable. To the rest of you I say, given we can find so many ways to divide ourselves, this isn’t one of the issues on which we need to seek division and we achieve great collective strength if we don’t. So I end with one of my favourite quotes, not biblical in this instance, but from Sun Tzu – one of history’s great military philosophers: “Strategy without tactics” he wrote “is the slowest route to victory”. “Tactics without strategy is the noise before defeat.” TCI now has a strategy. Within it, I’ve just described some of the tactics we are already employing and capability we are building. I, the Premier, the Commissioner and all those in this room, representing every branch of Government involved in this shared enterprise, are committed to delivering a safe environment. I hope you can, in your own way, feel part of this because in truth you – the public – are without doubt our greatest national security asset. Extrapolating slightly from the Sun Tzu quote: national unity, around national security, would be the fastest route to success. And with that, may God Bless these Turks and Caicos Islands."

The years of life lost, the family gatherings not attended and, for so many relatives, the missed chance even to say goodbye. I offer my deepest condolences to everyone who has lost a loved one: fathers and mothers; brothers and sisters; sons and daughters and the many grandparents who have been taken. And, to all those who grieve, we make this pledge: that when we have come through this crisis, we will come together as a nation to remember everyone we lost, and to honour the selfless heroism of all those on the front line who gave their lives to save others. We will remember the courage of countless working people – not just our amazing NHS and care workers, but shop workers, transport staff, pharmacists, teachers, police, armed forces emergency services and many others – who kept our country going during our biggest crisis since the Second World War. We will commemorate the small acts of kindness, the spirit of volunteering and the daily sacrifice of millions who placed their lives on hold time and again as we fought each new wave of the virus, buying time for our brilliant scientists to come to our aid. In that moment of commemoration, we will celebrate the genius and perseverance of those who discovered the vaccines and the immense national effort – never seen before in our history – which is now underway to distribute them, one that has now seen us immunise over 6.8 million people across the United Kingdom. And when those vaccines have finally freed us from this virus and put us on a path to recovery, we will make sure that we learn the lessons and reflect and prepare. And, until that time, the best and most important thing we can all do to honour the memory of those who have died is to work together with ever greater resolve to defeat this disease. And that is what we will do."
"Boris Johnson","Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 27 January 2021","27 January 2020","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-27-january-2021","When we look at the toll of this pandemic it must be measured not only in the tragic loss of life that we have endured with over 100,000 deaths and once again I offer my condolences to the families and friends of everybody who has lost loved ones - but I’m afraid we must also remember not just the damage to the economy, but the lost weeks and months of education and the real risk of damage to the prospects of our young people. And so I share very much the frustration of pupils and teachers who today want nothing more than to get back to the classroom. And I understand the stress and the anxieties of parents coping heroically with the pressures of homeschooling. And I know that everybody across the country wants us to get schools open as fast as possible And I can assure you that is the ambition of this Government. But I also know, we all know, that with 37,000 people in hospital suffering from covid and the infection rates still forbiddingly high you, we all, must be cautious and we all want only to open schools when we can be sure that this will not cause another huge surge in the disease. Because the problem is not that schools are unsafe teachers and headteachers have worked heroically to make sure that they are safe, that they are covid secure The problem is that by definition, schools bring many households together And that contributes to the spread of the virus within the community, and drives up the R. And so it follows that if we are to get schools open – and keep them open – which is what we all want then we need to be clear about certain things. We need to be sure the vaccine roll-out is continuing to be successful as it is and most important, we need to see the impact of our vaccines on those graphs of mortality, we need to see that they really are saving lives and preventing people from becoming seriously ill. Now we are confident that will happen and vaccines will have that effect but to be responsible we must see the proof. And our current estimates say that the proof will only become visible in the middle of February. And since we need to give schools two weeks’ notice to re-open it is sensible now to serve notice that we will not be able to re-open schools immediately after half-term on 22nd February. But if we continue to make the progress that we want to see, and that we believe we can see, Then we hope to begin opening schools on Monday 8th March. And to help parents and teachers with this extended period of remote learning We will extend the arrangements for providing free school meals for those eligible children not in school including food parcels and the national voucher scheme – until those pupils have returned to the classroom. And as we did this financial year, we will provide a catch-up programme over the next financial year, with a further £300 million of new money to schools for tutoring, and we will work with the education sector to develop, wherever appropriate, specific initiatives for summer schools as well as a Covid Premium for catch-up and to support pupils to catch up We will work with parents, teachers and schools to develop a long-term plan to make sure all pupils have the chance to make up their learning over the course of this Parliament, so we tackle that issue of differential learning and kids who may have fallen behind through no fault of their own And so with every jab that goes in we are becoming more confident that we will reach our target of offering a first dose to everyone in the top four priority groups by the middle of February. And at that moment we will be able to review our progress, judge the state of the pandemic, and the effectiveness of the vaccine, and then in the week beginning 22nd February we will set out our plan not just for re-opening our schools but gradually to re-open our economy and our society and to get our lives back to as close to normal as possible. Now this will be a timetable that is inevitably going to be subject to adjustment But I believe it will provide clarity and certainty about the way ahead, a roadmap that we can take together and use as a country to defeat the virus and begin steadily to reclaim our lives."
"Boris Johnson","PM speech at the UK Commemorative Ceremony for Holocaust Memorial Day","27 January 2020","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-speech-at-the-uk-commemorative-ceremony-for-holocaust-memorial-day","Last week Mala told me her story, including the scene that awaited Ian and our British forces when they liberated Bergen Belsen almost 75 years ago. I am lost in admiration for Mala’s courage and endurance and her unwavering determination to ensure that we remember. As she said to me, the Holocaust is unique, because it was the industrialised murder of a race, of 6 million Jews, of whom 1.5 million were children, along with millions of other targets of Nazi persecution. As Prime Minister, I promise that we will preserve this truth forever. I will make sure we build the National Holocaust Memorial and Education Centre, so that future generations can never doubt what happened, because that is the only way we can be certain that it never happens again. And I feel a deep sense of shame that here in Britain – in 2020 – we seem to be dealing with a resurgence of the virus of anti-semitism - and I know that I carry responsibility as Prime Minister to do everything possible to stamp it out. As we resolutely proclaim “never again”, it is right that we should also ask what happened to our resolve in the genocides that followed in Cambodia, Rwanda, Bosnia and Darfur. And as I stand here, in the presence of many of Britain’s Holocaust survivors, I feel a special obligation towards the sanctity of their testimonies, because nothing can compare with hearing directly from a survivor. I will do everything I can as Prime Minister to ensure these testimonies are shared as widely as possible, encouraging the use of technology so the tangible, palpable, irrefutable reality of this experience is preserved as something not just for this generation but for every generation. In doing so, we will ensure that Britain never forgets the truth of the Holocaust. In the name of all those who perished, may their memory be a blessing for ever."
"Boris Johnson","Andrea Leadsom addresses businesses at the Institute of Directors","29 January 2020","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/andrea-leadsom-addresses-businesses-at-the-institute-of-directors","It does seem you can’t go anywhere these days without stumbling upon yet more examples of brilliant UK creativity. I learned that ‘Downton Abbey’ was filmed here. And so from our creative industries to our universities; from offshore wind to outer space the UK does have a huge amount to shout about – and so tonight is a bit of a chance to do just that. I’m sure you’re all veterans of receptions like these and you’re used to politicians saying we’re at a ‘crossroads’, we’re at a ‘very important point’, now is a ‘profound chance at change’. But actually I think today of all days we are at a very important crossroads. In just over 50 hours, we will be leaving the European Union, marking the start of a brand new future, where we are free to choose our own path - with the certainty for business that a political majority provides. Boris Johnson’s government will provide the NHS with the biggest cash injection in its history. It will back our scientists, build better infrastructure, clean up our environment, and so much more under this new government. 2020 will be the year we lay the foundation for that future. But of course as you all know, without business we don’t stand a chance. I’ve always personally understood the power of business. When I was a kid my mother and stepdad had a furniture shop and the super-tax on the self-employed was 98%. In frustration, my parents wrote their tax cheque on the side of a wardrobe as their little bit of rebellion against the unfairness and anti-business nature of that government. Even back then for me as a teenager, the logic was quite clear: when business falters, the UK suffers; when business succeeds, the UK will prosper. When you thrive, you create more jobs, more opportunities for young people and better lives for families across the UK. You pay more taxes which pay for better public services. And you invest more in new infrastructure which makes life easier. And today, we’re seeing encouraging signs. This month, as you’ll all know, business confidence surged to a record high. And as we leave the EU – firms can continue to do business with confidence. Next week, businesses will be able to trade with EU markets exactly as they do today. And this will continue until the end of the transition period at the end of this year. Then, what should be clear to all - really strong message - is that things will change in January 2021. Firms will need to prepare for these changes, including leaving the EU’s customs union and single market. And we will provide detail, support and very close collaboration with business as negotiations on our free trade agreement with the EU progress. Ladies and gentlemen – this government will back business to the hilt. Now and in the future. By this Friday, I will personally have already met over 250 businesses as Secretary of State with all the superb insight, ideas and creativity that has demonstrated to me. And what I’m hearing from business right now is that you want to look beyond Brexit, to the exciting opportunities of the coming decades. So this evening, I’d like to do 3 things. First, I’d like to set out my department’s priorities. Second, I’d like to put forward a vision of what we can do, and what our new future can be if we all work together. And then third, I’d like to say a few words on Industrial Strategy. So let me take each in turn. Our priorities On my first day as Business Secretary, I sat down with my ministerial team, who are here – Kwasi Kwarteng, Chris Skidmore, Kelly Tolhurst, Nadhim Zahawi and Ian, Lord Duncan – to discuss our exam question that we gave to ourselves: What do we want BEIS to be famous for? The answer is the mission we have given ourselves: to build a stronger, greener United Kingdom, and within that we have agreed our 3 departmental priorities: first, that we will lead the world in tackling global climate change; second, that we will solve the Grand Challenges facing our society; and third that we will quite simply make the UK the best place in the world to work and to grow a business. Now I know these are all things that matter to you too. And since last summer we’ve made strong progress on each one of them. On climate change, we’ve doubled our International Climate Finance to nearly £12 billion. We’ve announced our £1 billion Ayrton Fund using the very best of British science and innovation to tackle climate change in developing countries - from replacing diesel generators with battery storage, to making air conditioning units more effective. And we’ve worked with business to invest in cleaner, greener transport – from electric planes, to freight-carrying drones, and in building electric infrastructure for green cars. And this is only the beginning. 2020 is just the first year in a new decade of decarbonisation, where we in government will work with business to eliminate our contribution to climate change by 2050. As well as prioritising our pathway to net zero, our second key priority in BEIS is in solving the Grand Challenges facing our society. Since I became Business Secretary: We’ve launched the world’s largest genetics project, which will sequence the genomes of 500,000 volunteers to better diagnose and treat diseases like cancer and dementia. And we’re aiming to design, develop and build the world’s first commercially viable fusion power plant by 2040 with the potential for clean, carbon-free and virtually unlimited energy. Our extraordinary researchers, innovators and universities will maintain the UK as a global science superpower. And we will be even more ambitious. We will set up a UK Advanced Research Projects Agency, giving researchers the freedom to pursue high-risk, high-reward projects. We will capitalise on our strengths – from driving forward a new National Space Council to building a world-first Medicines Manufacturing Innovation Centre. And this will all be underpinned by our commitment to increase our R&D spending across the UK to 2.4% of GDP by 2027. And then our third top priority in BEIS is to make the UK the best place in the world to work and to grow a business. This government will always back business to the hilt. We will review and reduce business rates. We will finally resolve the scourge of late payments. And we will forge a new trading relationship with the EU – as well as develop free trade agreements with old friends and new partners around the world. We will put in place reforms to keep the UK world-leading in audit, corporate governance and transparency. And our new Employment Bill will make sure work is fairly rewarded. I want to create a world where ‘flexible working’ is the norm, where we do more to support people as carers and parents and where we can all balance work with the other things that matter in our lives - ultimately, creating happier, more productive employees who can do even more for your business. So these 3 priorities will enable us to build a stronger, greener United Kingdom, and this brings me to my second point. Building a stronger, greener United Kingdom Today, we are on the cusp of a green industrial revolution, with opportunities not just for us here in ‘SW1’ but for everyone – in every postcode and part of our country. And the industries of the future are already creating new sources of pride and prosperity across our shores. Just take offshore wind. Today, Hull makes turbine blades for what will soon be the largest offshore wind farm in the world off the Yorkshire Coast; Grimsby leads the world in offshore wind operations and maintenance, while our Offshore Renewable Energy Catapult recently tested the world’s longest offshore wind turbine blade. If you stood it next to parliament, it would be taller than Big Ben! And I’m immensely proud that the UK now has more offshore wind than any other country on earth - a fantastic achievement, and the challenge now is to ramp up and scale up successes like these across the UK. From creating supply chains for electric vehicles to decarbonising heavy industry. From designing new, green financial products to designing low carbon buildings, the opportunities of this industrial revolution are endless, with the prize of two million green-collar jobs by 2030. And personally, I have no doubt that we will succeed. Because history shows we have done it before. Just as the UK helped bring the world the steam engine and jet engine so we can already export technologies which will help to decarbonise the world. And I think we could grow a clean tech sector which could be even bigger than our financial services sector today. I know that businesses in this room are already laying the foundations – and seeing the benefits. Investing in your workforce and in the future-proof skills young people need; backing new ideas putting billions into R&D, and expanding into new markets finding new customers all across the world. Industrial Strategy And this brings me to my final point – what can we in government do to help? In 2017, the Industrial Strategy established by my predecessor gave a comprehensive answer to that question. It’s an excellent document, with fantastic results. From Sector Deals helping industries speak with one voice, to ambitious Grand Challenge missions, like helping people to enjoy 5 extra years of healthy living, there’s a lot to celebrate about it. I want to build on this great work, through an Industrial Strategy for our regions and for future generations, which levels up opportunity across the UK and leads the world in tackling climate change. For me, there are opportunities to build on ‘what’ our Industrial Strategy does, ‘where’ it benefits across our UK and ‘who’ it involves. So let’s start with ‘what’? One of the 2017 Industrial Strategy’s trump cards was its Grand Challenges – clean growth, future of mobility, Artificial Intelligence and Data, and the Ageing Society. Yet one big change since 2017 is that last year we legislated for net zero by 2050. Making clean growth ‘the’ Grand Challenge of the 2020s – indeed of the century. So I’ve asked my team to look at how we can ‘net zero proof’ every aspect of our Industrial Strategy. On the question of ‘where?’, Local Industrial Strategies are already making a big difference – and I’m delighted that areas like Humber and the Heart of the South West are making good progress developing their local plans. These are absolutely in line with our desire to ‘level up’ our United Kingdom – but I do think we can go even further. So I’ve asked our officials to look at how else our Industrial Strategy can transform communities across the UK, improving productivity – a really key challenge - and offering new skills and new jobs, whilst reducing our carbon footprint. And finally, there’s the question of ‘who’? In the past, large firms have been really involved with our Industrial Strategy. That’s fantastic – lots more of that to come. But answering questions like net zero will mean harnessing every ounce of business innovation – through a strategy that also supports our SMEs. So to make our Industrial Strategy more open, I’ve asked my team to look at how we can make our many tens of existing funding streams far less complicated. So – an Industrial Strategy with more net zero, more resources for our regions, more support for our SMEs – but which makes it less complex to apply for funding, and less of an ordeal to access government support and advice. So ladies and gentlemen, as we look beyond Brexit, this is the perfect moment for government and business to consider how we can better work together. In government, we absolutely need business by our side. You are the job creators and you’re the problem-solvers; you’re the innovators and investors and today you matter more than ever. So together – let’s build a stronger, greener United Kingdom. Thank you."

A Britain that is simultaneously a great European power And truly global in our range and ambitions And when I look at this country’s incredible assets Our scientists, our engineers, our world-leading universities, our armed forces When I look at the potential of this country waiting to be unleashed I know that we can turn this opportunity into a stunning success And whatever the bumps in the road ahead I know that we will succeed We have obeyed the people We have taken back the tools of self-government Now is the time to use those tools to unleash the full potential of this brilliant country and to make better the lives of everyone in every corner of our United Kingdom."
"Boris Johnson","PM speech in Greenwich: 3 February 2020","3 February 2020","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-speech-in-greenwich-3-february-2020","It is great to welcome everyone here to Greenwich and I invite you first to raise your eyes to the heavens. The Vatican has Michelangelo. Greenwich has Thornhill who spent 20 years flat on his back on top of the scaffolding, so rigid that his arm became permanently wonky, and he’s left us this gorgeous and slightly bonkers symbolic scene that captures the spirit of the United Kingdom in the early 18th century. This painting above you was started in 1707, the very year when the union with Scotland was agreed – and does it not speak of supreme national self-confidence? Look at these well-fed nymphs and cupids and what have you. They are not just celebrating the Triumph of Liberty and Peace over Tyranny – the official title of the scene. This is the settlement of a long and divisive political question about who gets to sit on the throne of England. And it is visibly resolved as you can see in favour of William and Mary and the result is stability and certainty and optimism and an explosion of global trade propelled by new maritime technology. And above and around us you can see the anchors, cables, rudders, sails, oars, ensigns, powder barrels, sextants, the compasses and the grappling irons. In fact the only important bit of kit that is missing is Harrison’s sea clock – also exhibited close-by here in Greenwich and also commissioned in the same era, that allowed every ship in the world to determine how far they were from this Meridian. So this is it. This is the newly forged United Kingdom on the slipway: this is the moment when it all took off. And - you know where this is going - today if we get it right, if we have the courage to follow the instincts and the instructions of the British people, this can be another such moment on the launching pad. Because once again we have settled a long-running question of sovereign authority, we have ended a debate that has run for three and a half years - some would say 47 years. I won’t even mention the name of the controversy except to say that it begins with B. Receding in the past behind us. We have the opportunity, we have the newly recaptured powers, we know where we want to go, and that is out into the world. And today in Geneva as our ambassador Julian Braithwaite moves seats in the WTO and takes back control of our tariff schedules, an event in itself that deserves itself to be immortalised in oil - this country is leaving its chrysalis. We are re-emerging after decades of hibernation as a campaigner for global free trade. And frankly it is not a moment too soon because the argument for this fundamental liberty is now not being made. We in the global community are in danger of forgetting the key insight of those great Scottish thinkers, the invisible hand of Adam Smith, and of course David Ricardo’s more subtle but indispensable principle of comparative advantage, which teaches that if countries learn to specialise and exchange then overall wealth will increase and productivity will increase, leading Cobden to conclude that free trade is God’s diplomacy – the only certain way of uniting people in the bonds of peace since the more freely goods cross borders the less likely it is that troops will ever cross borders. And since these notions were born here in this country, it has been free trade that has done more than any other single economic idea to raise billions out of poverty and incredibly fast. In 1990 there were 37 percent of the world’s population in absolute poverty - that is now down to less than ten per cent. And yet my friends, I am here to warn you today that this beneficial magic is fading. Free trade is being choked and that is no fault of the people, that’s no fault of individual consumers, I am afraid it is the politicians who are failing to lead. The mercantilists are everywhere, the protectionists are gaining ground. From Brussels to China to Washington tariffs are being waved around like cudgels even in debates on foreign policy where frankly they have no place - and there is an ever growing proliferation of non-tariff barriers and the resulting tensions are letting the air out of the tyres of the world economy. World trading volumes are lagging behind global growth. Trade used to grow at roughly double global GDP – from 1987 to 2007. Now it barely keeps pace and global growth is itself anaemic and the decline in global poverty is beginning to slow. And in that context, we are starting to hear some bizarre autarkic rhetoric, when barriers are going up, and when there is a risk that new diseases such as coronavirus will trigger a panic and a desire for market segregation that go beyond what is medically rational to the point of doing real and unnecessary economic damage, then at that moment humanity needs some government somewhere that is willing at least to make the case powerfully for freedom of exchange, some country ready to take off its Clark Kent spectacles and leap into the phone booth and emerge with its cloak flowing as the supercharged champion, of the right of the populations of the earth to buy and sell freely among each other. And here in Greenwich in the first week of February 2020, I can tell you in all humility that the UK is ready for that role. We are ready for the great multi-dimensional game of chess in which we engage in more than one negotiation at once and we are limbering up to use nerves and muscles and instincts that this country has not had to use for half a century. Secretary of State Liz Truss tells me she has the teams in place: She has the lawyers, top dollar I’ve no doubt, the economists, trade policy experts and if we don’t have enough, or if they don’t perform, believe me we will hire some more. We will reach out to the rest of the Commonwealth,which now has some of the fastest growing economies in the world. It was fantastic at the recent Africa summit to see how many wanted to turn that great family of nations into a free trade zone, even if we have to begin with clumps and groups, and we will take these ideas forward at Kigali in June. We will engage with Japan and the other Trans-Pacific agreement countries, with old friends and partners - Australia, New Zealand, Canada - on whom we deliberately turned our backs in the early 1970s. We will get going with our friends in America and I share the optimism of Donald Trump and I say to all the naïve and juvenile anti-Americans in this country if there are any – there seem to be some - I say grow up – and get a grip. The US already buys one fifth of everything we export. And yes of course there are going to be difficulties: Our shower trays seem to fall foul of US rules Liz, and if you want to sell insurance across America, Mr Ambassador, you still have to deal with 50 separate regulators, and it is high time I think we all agree that they cut their punitive tariffs on Scotch whisky. And it goes without saying to all those conspiracy theorists who may still be in existence, all those believers in the Bermuda Triangle or who think that Elvis will be found on Mars, It goes without saying that of course the NHS is not on the table and no we will not accept any diminution in food hygiene or animal welfare standards. But I must say to the America bashers in this country if there are any that in doing free trade deals we will be governed by science and not by mumbo-jumbo because the potential is enormous. And of course that brings me to the other area where the potential is great we want a thriving trade and economic relationship with the EU, our historic friend, partners, neighbours and I shall table a parliamentary statement today spelling out our objectives. And at the outset I wish to reassure our friends about one thing: to lay one myth to rest. We will not engage in some cut-throat race to the bottom. We are not leaving the EU to undermine European standards, we will not engage in any kind of dumping whether commercial, or social, or environmental, and don’t just listen to what I say or what we say, look at what we do. And I say respectfully to our friends that in all those three crucial areas the anxiety should really be on our side of the Channel not yours. Look at state aid: France spends twice as much on state aid as the UK, and Germany three times as much, who is using subsidies to undercut? Not the UK. In fact, the EU has enforced state aid rules against the UK only four times in the last 21 years, compared with 29 enforcement actions against France, 45 against Italy – and 67 against Germany. The same applies even more emphatically to social policy – and here again I dispel the absurd caricature of Britain as a nation bent on the slash and burn of workers’ rights and environmental protection, as if we are saved from Dickensian squalor only by enlightened EU regulation, as if it was only thanks to Brussels that we are not preparing to send children back up chimneys. In one field after another, Britain is far ahead. The EU waited until last year before introducing two weeks of paid paternity leave; we in the UK guaranteed that right nearly two decades ago. The EU gives employees the right to request flexible working only if they are parents or carers. The UK provides that right to every employee with more than six months’ service – and they can make the request for any reason. The EU provides a minimum of 14 weeks paid maternity leave; Britain offers up to a year, with 39 weeks paid and an option to convert this to shared parental leave. How about that. The UK has a higher minimum wage than all but three EU member states: in fact six EU countries have no minimum wage at all. As for the environment, look at animal welfare. It is not just that we want to go further than the EU in banning live shipment of animals: there are ways in which we already are further ahead. The UK banned veal crates fully 16 years before the EU. We are protecting elephants by introducing one of the strictest ivory bans in the world; and the EU, meanwhile, is still in the consultation stage. And on the great environmental issue of our time, perhaps the greatest issue facing humanity, Britain was the first major economy in the world – let alone the EU – to place upon our own shoulders a legal obligation to be carbon neutral by 2050. That will put huge strains on our system, it will require full effort and change but we know we can do it. We have cut our carbon emissions by nearly twice the EU average since 1990, 42 percent and we have cut while the GDP has grown by about 70%; but here is the question: are we going to insist that the EU does everything that we do, as the price of free trade? Are we? Of course not. Our legislation to ban single-use plastics goes further and faster than anything proposed by the EU. Does that mean we will refuse to accept a zero-tariff zero-quota deal with the EU unless the EU agrees to match us every step of the way? Will we stop Italian cars or German wine from entering this country tariff free, or quota free, unless the EU matches our UK laws on plastic coffee stirrers or maternity leave or unless they match our laws in any other field of policy that might conceivably affect the production of an Alfa Romeo or a bottle of gewurtztraminer? Will we accuse them of dumping? Of course not. Or wanting to dump? Of course not. So I hope our friends will understand that what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. There is no need for a free trade agreement to involve accepting EU rules on competition policy, subsidies, social protection, the environment, or anything similar any more than the EU should be obliged to accept UK rules. The UK will maintain the highest standards in these areas – better, in many respects, than those of the EU – without the compulsion of a treaty. And it is vital to say this now clearly because we have so often been told that we must choose between full access to the EU market, along with accepting its rules and courts on the Norway model, or a free trade agreement, which opens up markets and avoids the full panoply of EU regulation, like the Canada deal. Well folks I hope you’ve got the message by now. We have made our choice: we want a comprehensive free trade agreement, similar to Canada’s. But in the very unlikely event that we do not succeed, then our trade will have to be based on our existing Withdrawal Agreement with the EU. The choice is emphatically not “deal or no-deal”. We have a deal – we’ve done it and yes it did turn out as I prophesized to be oven ready. The question is whether we agree a trading relationship with the EU comparable to Canada’s – or more like Australia’s. And I have no doubt that in either case the UK will prosper. And of course our new relationship with our closest neighbours will range far beyond trade. We will seek a pragmatic agreement on security, on protecting our citizens without trespassing on the autonomy of our respective legal systems. I hope that we can reach an agreement on aviation, allowing cheap flights to continue. We are ready to consider an agreement on fisheries, but it must reflect the fact that the UK will be an independent coastal state at the end of this year 2020, controlling our own waters. And under such an agreement, there would be annual negotiations with the EU, using the latest scientific data, ensuring that British fishing grounds are first and foremost for British boats. And in all these other areas, I see the same need for warmth, we’ll deliver that or cooperation for friendship and exchange and va et vien, for academics, students and businesses but I see no need to bind ourselves to an agreement with the EU. We will restore full sovereign control over our borders and immigration, competition and subsidy rules, procurement and data protection. And while we will always co-operate with our European friends in foreign and defence policy whenever our interests converge – as they often, if not always, will – this will not in my view necessarily require any new treaty or institutions because we will not need them for the simple reason that the UK is not a European power by treaty or by law but by irrevocable facts of history and geography and language and culture and instinct and sentiment. And I have set in train the biggest review of our foreign defence and security policies since the Cold War, which is designed to seize the opportunities that lie ahead and make sure that we play our part in addressing the world’s problems. I know we will do it in cooperation with our European friends. And I say to our European friends – many of whom I’m delighted to see in this room – we are here as ever, as we have been for decades, for centuries, to support and to help as we always have done for the last hundred years or more and the reason I stress this need for full legal autonomy, the reason we do not seek membership or part membership of the customs union or alignment of any kind, is at least partly that I want this country to be an independent actor and catalyst for free trade across the world. I was there when they negotiated the Uruguay round. I saw it completed in Geneva when they gavelled it out - And it was one of those events that people hardly reported, but it was a fantastically important event in the life of the world. And it was a critical moment in my view that helped to lead to almost two decades of global growth and confidence. And then in 2008 we saw the abject failure of the Doha round and though there were many culprits there can be no doubt that both the EU and the US bear a heavy share of the blame for their refusal to compromise on farm subsidies. And of course while we were in, the voice of the UK was of course muffled. And as we come out. I don’t wish to exaggerate our influence or our potential influence, but then nor would I minimise the eagerness of our friends around the world to hear once again our independent voice again in free trade negotiations and our objective is to get things started again not just because it is right for the world, but because of course it is right for Britain because this people’s government believes that the whole country will benefit. Because it will help our national programme to unite and level up and bring together our whole United Kingdom. And by expanding our trading relationships to improve the productivity of the entire nation by expanding infrastructure, education and technology you know that our programme is to bring this country together, combine that with greater free trade. And of course I hope you will see us exporting more fantastic ships built on the Clyde, more wonderful bone china pottery from Northern Ireland, beef from Wales. The opportunities as I say are extraordinary. It is an incredible fact that we still sell not one hamburger’s worth of beef to the US, not one kebab’s worth of lamb, and as I speak the people of the US are still surviving without an ounce of Scottish haggis which they continue to ban Mr Ambassador. In fact I don’t know how they manage Burns Night. I am glad to say that the Chinese last year signed the first agreement to take British beef after a 20-year ban, but still no lamb, not a joint, not a chop, not a deep frozen moussaka, even though we have the best lamb in the world. And don’t tell me the issue is distance from China. Let me ask you a question, see if you’ve been paying attention to this speech the New Zealanders sell huge and growing quantities of lamb to China, as indeed they do to America. Let me ask you which is closer to Beijing? Wales or New Zealand? Does anybody know? Wales of course is the correct answer. There is no reason why we cannot do much, much better and I am deeply proud of this – I don’t want to do down this country’s global exporting spirit. We do extraordinary things as I never tire of telling you. Tea to China, cake to France, TV aerials to South Korea and so on. Boomerangs to Australia - Nigel Farage to America. Then he came back of course. But this is the moment for us to think of our past and go up a gear again, to recapture the spirit of those seafaring ancestors immortalised above us whose exploits brought not just riches but something even more important than that – and that was a global perspective. That is our ambition. There lies the port, the vessel puffs her sail…the wind sits in the mast. We are embarked now on a great voyage, a project that no one thought in the international community that this country would have the guts to undertake, but if we are brave and if we truly commit to the logic of our mission - open, outward-looking - generous, welcoming, engaged with the world championing global free trade now when global free trade needs a global champion, I believe we can make a huge success of this venture, for Britain, for our European friends, and for the world."
"Boris Johnson","PM speech at COP 26 Launch: 4 February 2020","4 February 2020","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-speech-at-cop-26-launch-4-february-2020","Good morning everybody, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Sir David, Ladies and Gentlemen I am thrilled to welcome you all to the launch of what I hope will be a defining year of action for our country, and indeed for our planet, on tackling climate change but also on protecting the natural world now when I used to come in a long time ago as a kid, as I’m sure all of us have done, there used to be a very curious exhibit on the way in – which unfortunately doesn’t seem to be there – it’s been removed, I think, for repair in Yorkshire or somewhere it is a very curious carriage, and it looks like the sort of thing that could have carried Madame Bovary around Paris except it wasn’t pulled by horses this carriage - can you see the thing in your mind - it is an electric taxi - the world’s first - and it was invented by an unsung genius called Walter Bersey in 1897 And Walter Bersey like many of us in this room was a total nut for electric vehicles he built an electric bus that went 4000 miles, this is around 1895 he built a series of electric vans and he built a total of 75 of these taxis, and they were popular and commodious, velvet lined and effective because they could turn on a dime they obeyed all the TFL scriptures, and they could mount Savoy hill, which was the steepest in central London But the tragedy for Bersey, and the tragedy for humanity was that he allowed himself to be daunted in what he was trying to do because he was in the end defeated by the sceptics and those who thought that his efforts were technologically impossible First he was fined for going too fast - his vehicles could get up to 12 mph - and he was fined for going down parliament street without a chap in front carrying a red flag, which you had to have in those days and he did admittedly, as time went on, experience some minor technological issues the beautiful glass batteries that he had that weighed only two tonnes, were not always reliable, the tyres gave way under the strain and eventually his electric taxis - so lovely and so convenient - were subject to a growing hostile whispering campaign by those who were wedded to the old technology, the ostlers and the coachmen and everyone else in involved in horse drawn vehicles and in the end, and the end came pretty soon for Bersey, he gave up, and he concluded that it was impossible He wound up his company, surrendered to the internal combustion engine in 1899 and that was the last electric taxi on the streets of London for more than a century, 110 years in fact, until a certain visionary mayor decided to launch a campaign in 2008, and there they are, you can see them all over the streets, or hybrids anyway, and as you look at that Bersey taxi it is impossible not to feel the pathos It’s as though humanity came 110 years ago - more than that 120 years ago - to a fork in the road - and took the wrong way And look at what happened in the century since Bersey despaired We have had a catastrophic period in which the global addiction to hydrocarbons has got totally out of control We’ve poured so much CO2 into the atmosphere collectively that our entire planet is swaddled in a great tea cosy of the stuff CO2 levels today are at a level not seen since 3 million years ago when there were trees on Antarctica, Since Bersey despaired of his electric taxi, the temperature of the planet has gone up by one degree, and it is now predicted, unless we take urgent action, to get three degrees hotter And in the hurricanes and the bushfires and the melting of the ice caps, and the acidification of the oceans, the evidence is now overwhelming and it is taking its toll, this phenomenon of global warming is taking its toll on the most vulnerable populations around the planet, which is why the UK has now committed to £11.6bn in tackling global climate change and in financing climate initiatives around the world And we know, everyone – and it’s fantastic to see so many people here this morning – because I think we all know that as a country and as a society, as a planet, as a species, we must now act and we in the UK, will do everything we can to support our Chinese friends in their biodiversity COP which is also coming up in the Autumn and I think it’s very important there should be a link between the two and there should be a clear sharing of the agenda, because we must reverse the appalling loss of habitats and species It’s only by repairing the damage to the natural world and restoring the balance between humanity and nature - which is now so grotesquely out of kilter that we can address the problem of climate change and of course at the same time we have to deal with our CO2 emissions and that is why the UK is calling for us to get to net zero as soon as possible, for every county to announce credible targets to get there, what’s we want from Glasgow and that is why we are pledged here in the UK to deliver net zero by 2050 and we’re the first major economy to make that commitment, I think it’s the right thing to do, I think it’s quite proper that should, we were the first after all, to industrialise. Look at historic emissions of the UK we have a responsibility to our planet to lead in this way and to do this, and of course there are people in this country – not necessarily in the Treasury - and people around the world who may say, of course it’s expensive, of course it’s difficult, it will require thought and change and action, people will say it’s impossible and it can’t be done, and my message to you all this morning is that they are wrong and if you look at what this country has done, since 1990 - cutting CO2 by 42 per cent and at the same time seeing a 73% increase in the GDP of this country We have done that through sheer determination and technological optimism in 1990 70 per cent of the power of this country came from coal it’s now down to 3 per cent - and we want to get it to zero by 2024 and that is because, we’re able to do that, because this county is leading a revolution in renewable energy and by the way, it’s driving our national agenda of uniting and levelling up our country, because it’s parts of the North and the North East of the country in particular, that are showing the lead in renewable energy the world’s biggest offshore wind turbines are built beside the Humber, the carbon capture storage is being pioneered on the banks of the Tees. one in five electric vehicles sold in Europe is built on the banks of where - the Wear. And there you go. So I say to all those who doubted Walter Bersey, eat your heart out, because his basic idea has triumphed, hasn’t it? And the thing that they thought to be impossible has actually proved to be the solution, And even the aviation industry is now committing to be carbon neutral by 2050 well we are on the verge, I’m assured, within a couple of years of having viable electric passenger aircraft And we will get there, we will get there And that is the lesson of that electric taxi that I wanted to look at and speculate about mournfully. it is not that Walter Bersey was wrong, he wasn’t wrong he was wrong to doubt himself and the sceptics are wrong to doubt the promethean genius of humanity to solve these problems So we will crack it and I hope that we can as a planet and as a community of nations get to net zero, as I say, within decades We’re going to do it by 2050, we’re setting the pace, I hope everybody will come with us and let’s work with Giuseppe, let’s work with our Italian friends to make COP 26 a great success, a fantastic success for our country and for our planet and let’s make this year the moment when we come together with the courage and the technological ambition to solve man-made climate change and to choose a cleaner and greener future for all our children and grandchildren."
"Boris Johnson","PM statement on transport infrastructure: 11 February 2020","11 February 2020","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-statement-on-transport-infrastructure-11-february-2020","Mr Speaker, there are all sorts of reasons why the city in which we now sit is the most productive region in the whole of Europe the time zone, the language, the agglomeration of talents and above all we have the mass transit system that every day conveys millions of people efficiently and affordably with tubes and trains and 8600 buses into the central activities zone in the morning and out in the evening like the respiration of some vast undersea coelenterate and as that public transport network has expanded in the last 150 years it has brought hope and opportunity and job prospects to people growing up in every part of the city and beyond and it is the ambition of this government to employ that same utensil - fantastic transport infrastructure - to unite and level up across the whole country and of course there is far more to do in London - and the present mayor frankly needs to be shaken out of his complacency - but there is even more to do across the nation as a whole Whether you are stuck in a jam on the A303 or on the outskirts of Lincoln whether you are trying to get from Warrington to Manchester or toiling across the Pennines by rail you know that this country is being held back by our inadequate infrastructure and so in the next few weeks this government will be setting out more details of a transport revolution because we all know the potential of transport to change your life and the life of your town or city and we know that efficient transport can clean the air and cut pollution and get cars off the road We can simultaneously reach our ambition of net zero by 2050 and we can shorten your commute and give you more time with your family and increase productivity and bring business and investment to left behind communities and that is why we are embarking now on a massive programme of investment in local transport Starting with a record-breaking £5 billion of new investment in buses and bicycles. An investment that will mean bus passengers across the country seeing a dramatic improvement in their daily journeys. More than 4,000 brand-new buses on the roads – zero carbon British built buses –on the roads of places Ashfield, Barnstaple, Southampton, Manchester and many more towns and cities besides. More services, including in the evenings and weekends. Simpler, cheaper and more convenient ticketing. Properly designed priority schemes to speed passengers past the traffic jams. And it’s an investment that will also mean cyclists enjoying hundreds of miles of brand-new separated lanes. With “Mini-Hollands” blooming like so many tulips in towns and cities right across the country. And that £5 billion, Mr Speaker. is just the start My very good friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer will be making a full announcement on this in next month’s Budget and I have no desire to steal his thunder. but I can signal today that we are taking forward transformative investments improvements from Cornwall, to the A1 north of Newcastle from south Salisbury to south Ribble from Cheadle to Chiverton dual carriageways, roundabouts, bypasses, underpasses And those are just the roads. We have already set out plans to explore new investments in the rail network across the North. Developing proposals to reopen the Fleetwood Line in Lancashire and Ashington-Blyth rail line in the North East. Improving track and platform capacity at Middlesbrough station. And installing new signalling at Harrogate, one of North Yorkshire’s busiest stations. And further south, I can today announce that we will be upgrading the Bristol East junction – a major pinch point in the rail network of the South West that limits access to the Brunel-designed Victorian splendour of Bristol Temple Meads Station. Mr Speaker the transport revolution is local because it must be local we can unite and level up across the country with fantastic local improvements with better rail and less congested roads and beautiful built buses that are cleaner, greener, quieter and above all more frequent and above all we can improve the quality of life and improve their productivity we can make places more attractive to live in and to invest in but we cannot make these improvements in isolation from one another because we will only be doing half the job we will not fix the great musculoskeletal problem of UK transport yes we must fix the joint between the knee bone and the thigh bone and the shin bone and the ankle bone and yes we must fix the arthritis in the fingers and the toes but we also have to fix the spine, Mr Speaker and our generation faces a historic choice We can try to get by with the existing routes from north to south we can consign the next generation to overcrowding, standing up in the carriageways or we can have the guts to take a decision – no matter how difficult –unlike the party opposite by the way Mr Speaker – no matter how difficult and controversial – that will deliver prosperity to every part of the country 50 minutes off the time to Glasgow When it comes to advocating HS2 it must be said that the task is not made easier by HS2 Ltd – the company concerned Speaking as an MP whose constituency is on the route I cannot say that HS2 Ltd has distinguished itself in the handling of local communities As everybody knows, the cost forecasts have exploded But poor management to date has not detracted in my view from the fundamental value of the project. The review recently conducted by Douglas Oakervee copies of which will be placed in the library of the House leaves no doubt of the clinching case for high speed rail A vast increase in capacity, with hundreds of thousands of extra seats. making it so much easier for travellers to move up and down our long, narrow country. That means faster journey times Not just more capacity – it means faster journey times extraordinarily fast journey times Passengers arriving at Birmingham Airport will be able to get to central London by train in 38 minutes which compares favourably with the time it takes to get from Heathrow by taxi – a point I just draw attention to the house but this is not just about getting from London to Birmingham and back this is about finally making – and considerably faster than the Piccadilly line – finally making a rapid connection from the west Midlands to the northern powerhouse to Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds and simultaneously permitting us to go forward with Northern powerhouse rail across the Pennines finally giving the home of the railways the fast connections they need and none of it makes any sense without HS2 The Infrastructure and Projects Authority considers that this first phase can be delivered for its current projected cost of £35 billion to £45 billion in today’s prices. The designs have been improved immeasurably thanks to the tireless contributions of campaigners including the Rt Hon Member for Chesham and Amersham. And if we start now, services could be running by the end of the decade. So today Mr Speaker, the Cabinet has given high speed rail the green signal. We are going to get this done. And to ensure that we do so without further blowouts on either cost or schedule, we are today taking decisive action to restore discipline to the programme. I will be appointing a Minister whose full-time job will be to oversee the project. A new Ministerial oversight group will be tasked with taking strategic decisions about it. There will be changes to the way HS2 is managed. We will, in line with Oakervee’s recommendations, be interrogating the current costs to identify where savings can be made in phase 1 without the costs and delays that would be associated with a detailed redesign. And, so that the company can focus solely on getting phases 1 and 2A built on something approaching on time and on budget I will be creating new delivery arrangements for both the grossly behind-schedule Euston terminus, and phase 2B of the wider project. But before those designs are finalised and legislation introduced, we will also present an integrated plan for rail in the north. Informed by an assessment from the National Infrastructure Commission it will, in line with the findings of the Oakervee review, look at how we can best design and integrate rail investments across the north – including Northern Powerhouse Rail between Leeds and Manchester, - and I have just spoken to the Mayor of Greater Manchester who has warmly welcomed this project - which I committed to supporting I remember during my first days in office. I want the plan to identify the most effective design and sequencing of all relevant investments in the north. For example, with many in the north crying out for better east/west links instead of improved north/south ones, which you’ve heard many times in this house …some have suggested delaying or even cancelling HS2 in order to get Northern Powerhouse Rail done more quickly. But I want to say to you Mr Speaker and to the House, this is not an either/or proposition. Both are needed, and both will be built – as quickly and cost-effectively as possible. To make sure that happens we will, working closely with northern leaders, explore options for creating a new delivery vehicle for Northern Powerhouse Rail. And we will start treating HS2, north of Birmingham, Northern Powerhouse Rail and other local rail improvements as part of one integrated masterplan, High Speed North. Because something has to change. Those who deny this, who say we should simply build 2B and Northern Powerhouse Rail according to the plans currently on the table, are effectively condemning the North to get nothing for 20 years. And that would be intolerable. So as we draw up this plan we are not asking whether phase 2B is not to be. That is not the question, Mr Speaker The question is how we can bring a transport revolution to the north sooner. Together, this revolution in local and national transport has the potential to be truly transformative for the entire country. Yes, it is ambitious. But ambition frankly is what we have lacked for too long. Two centuries ago our ancestors could have been content with breeding faster horses. Instead, they invented the railways. They created the transport network on which the United Kingdom rose to economic pre-eminence. They looked to the future of transport and they made it happen and today it is our duty to do the same. Let us bring about a future where high-speed trains glide between our great cities. Where electric buses convey us cleanly around our towns. Where self-driving cars roam along roads that are free of the congestion that causes so much pollution. And where a new generations of cyclists pedal safely and happily to school and work in tree dappled sunlight on their own network of fully segregated cycle paths. This government – as we did in London - will deliver a new anatomy of British transport A revolution in this nation’s public transport provision. And a sign to the world that in the 21st century this United Kingdom still has the vision to dream big dreams and the courage to bring those dreams about. I commend this statement to the House."
"Boris Johnson","Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 15 February 2021","15 February 2020","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-15-february-2021","Today the national vaccination programme continues to power past the target we set six weeks ago with more than 15 million people vaccinated across the UK. And once again I pay tribute to the astonishing efforts of everyone involved – the GPs, the nurses, the volunteers, the army and the pharmacists like Hardik Desai - who rallied local volunteers to vaccinate 3,000 people in his village hall in Ticehurst in Sussex, while keeping his pharmacy open - and of course I thank all of you who have come forward to be vaccinated. This is an unprecedented national achievement but it’s no moment to relax and in fact it’s the moment to accelerate because the threat from this virus remains very real. Yes, it’s true, we have vaccinated more than 90 per cent of those aged over 70 but don’t forget that 60 per cent of hospital patients with Covid are under 70. And although the vaccination programme is going well, we still don’t have enough data about the exact effectiveness of the vaccines in reducing the spread of infection. We have some interesting straws in the wind. We have grounds for confidence. But the vaccinations have only been running for a matter of weeks - and while we are learning the whole time - we don’t today have all the hard facts that we need. And the level of infection remains very high, with more people still in hospital today than at the peak last April and admissions running at 1,600 a day. So we have to keep our foot to the floor. And I can tell you today that the next million letters are landing on people’s mats right now, offering appointments to the over-65s and we are also contacting all those aged between 16 and 64 with underlying health conditions, as well as adult carers. And if we can keep this pace up – and if we can keep supply steady – and I hope and believe we can - then we hope to offer a vaccination to everyone in the first nine priority groups – including everyone over 50 – by the end of April. And at the same time we will be giving second doses to millions of the most vulnerable within twelve weeks of the first. So this moment is a huge step forward but it’s only a first step. And while it shows what the country can do we must be both optimistic but also patient. And next week I will be setting out a roadmap saying as much as we possibly can about the route to normality even though some things are very uncertain. Because we want this lockdown to be the last. And we want progress to be cautious but also irreversible. So please continue to stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives. Thank you."
"Boris Johnson","COP26 President Alok Sharma at launch of COP26 Private Finance Agenda","27 February 2020","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/cop26-president-alok-sharma-at-launch-of-cop26-private-finance-agenda","Ladies and gentlemen, Sir David, Governor Carney, Tanya. Let me start by thanking the Lord Mayor for hosting us today.   It is staggering to think that over 600 years have passed since the Guildhall’s master mason, John Croxton, started work on this incredible building.   Today, this is the only secular stone building in the City dating back from before 1666.   In part, thanks to the choices Croxton made all those years ago.   When the Great Fire of London ravaged the City, the Guildhall’s oak frame is said to have saved it from collapse. And when it was bombed in World War II, the roof fell in, but his stone walls stood firm.   With COP26 this year, we want to do what John Croxton did all those centuries ago.   Leave a legacy which stands the test of time, and makes life better for future generations.   Building on the foundations of past conferences, especially Paris, to create a zero-carbon economy which will benefit our children and grandchildren.    COP26 will be the biggest summit the UK has ever organised. In this year, the Year of Climate Action, it will be the top international priority for this Government. And we are getting ready for it.   In my first fortnight as COP President, I have been listening to those who have done this before. Meeting people like Paris COP President Laurent Fabius, UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed and Patricia Espinosa from the UNFCCC. And, we are working closely with our partners in Italy. Our vision for COP26 is clear. In Glasgow, the world must ramp up momentum towards a zero-carbon economy. Sending out a message of hope, that decarbonisation is the future. With huge opportunities for those who are prepared to act now.   And, of course, this transition must be fair and inclusive, leaving no-one behind.To achieve this, all countries must commit to significant further cuts to carbon emissions by 2030, and to reach net zero as soon as possible.   Agreeing a package that delivers the Paris Agreement and powers the UN climate process forward. And we will do that, working with all parts of the global economy and society. But there are some areas which need particular attention in 2020. First, adaptation and resilience, helping people, economies and the environment adapt and prepare for the impacts of climate change. This was a personal priority for me when I was Secretary of State for International Development. Working with Egypt, and others at the UN General Assembly, we launched a Call for Action on adaptation and resilience where 118 nations and over 80 organisations committed to raising their ambition. The next step is to translate these political commitments into on the ground action.    Second, nature, safeguarding ecosystems, protecting natural habitats and keeping carbon out of the atmosphere. Promoting nature-based solutions.   Third, energy transition, seizing the massive opportunities of cheaper renewables and storage. Cleaning our air, and helping economies shift away from a legacy of polluting fossil generation. Fourth, clean road transport, accelerating the move to zero-carbon road transport.   And fifth, to make this all possible, unleashing the finance which will power the shift to a zero-carbon economy. From solar panels, to electric vehicles and tree planting, it is often finance that turns good intentions into action. All of you here are in a unique position to drive the transition to a zero-carbon economy.   Helping developing countries leapfrog the polluting options of the past, to the clean, green, resilient technologies of the future. Last month, I helped launch East Africa’s first ‘green bond’ on the Nairobi securities exchange. Followed by its dual listing on the London Stock Exchange. The first Green Simba bond. A bond which UK Government funding helped to develop. Raising funds to build environmentally-friendly housing for 5,000 students in Nairobi. The OECD estimates that we will need nearly 7 trillion dollars a year up to 2030 to meet the Paris Agreement, as well the development goals. Much of this funding needs to come from the private sector. Whilst I was at the Department for International Development I set up the UK’s International Development Infrastructure Commission to help corral private sector money, alongside sovereign development funds, into sustainable infrastructure projects in developing countries. Following the Commission’s recommendations, the UK is now partnering with five countries in Africa to design a new facility to plan, deliver and support funding to a range of infrastructure projects that are attractive to businesses and investors like you. Sustainability will be central to these new infrastructure projects, focusing on investments with low carbon emissions and infrastructure that will be resilient to changing climates. The UK and other developed countries have committed to mobilising 100 billion dollars a year by 2020, building on the 71 billion we reached in 2017. We are firmly committed to this goal. And to meet it in a way that responds to the needs of developing countries. And last year at the UN General Assembly, Prime Minister Boris Johnson underlined his personal commitment to tackling climate change by announcing a doubling of the UK’s international climate finance commitment to 11.6 billion pounds over the period 2021-25. This, in turn, will mobilise further finance from public and private sources. Helping us meet and indeed move beyond the 100-billion-dollar goal, as we begin discussions on the goal that will replace it from 2025. Today, Multilateral Development Banks are the largest vehicle for channelling climate finance to developing countries. And donor support will remain critical as we shift to low carbon investment and protect the world’s most vulnerable. Last October, I made the UK’s backing for the World Bank fund dependent on putting more money into developing resilience to a changing climate. And we will continue to work with Multilateral Development Banks and Development Finance Institutions to help them deliver Paris Alignment Plans. But to move from billions to trillions, we will need all finance to look at aligning with the Paris Agreement. Making the spirit of Paris felt in London, New York, Frankfurt, Tokyo, Shanghai and every other financial centre around the world. Encouragingly today, as the financial risks and opportunities of the low carbon transition become clear, we are seeing a major shift in private finance. This shift is based on a simple fact. The only economy which can avoid the worst effects of climate change, and thus continue to deliver growth, is a decarbonised economy. I know Governor Carney will be speaking about this in just a moment. Of course we are seeing firms moving beyond Corporate Social Responsibility and funding green projects, to integrate climate and environmental factors into decision-making across all sectors and asset classes. Focusing on impact and not just return. We are starting to see real momentum. Campaigns like ‘Make My Money Matter’ are giving a voice to those who want to see their pensions invested in line with their values. Last year, a survey by the Department for International Development found that the vast majority of UK savers wanted their investments to be made in a manner which considers the impact on people and planet, alongside financial performance.   As part of COP26, we will be supporting private sector coalitions to do even more, sooner, helping them look at the climate impacts of asset portfolios and loan books. Ladies and gentlemen, I started by mentioning the origins of the Guildhall. Centuries ago, a historian described how it grew from a “little cottage” into a “large and great house”. And, in many ways, that is what we need for COP26. From governments, businesses, civil society, young people and so many others, we are opening up our doors and inviting absolutely everyone in. Each of us will write the future. Our choices will make or break the zero-carbon economy. Together, I know we can make the right decisions. Thank you."
"Boris Johnson","Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 3 March 2020","3 March 2020","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-statement-at-coronavirus-press-conference-3-march-2020","Good morning and thank you for coming along, and I am very glad to be joined this morning by the government’s Chief Medical Officer and Chief Scientific Advisor. Today we have published the Coronavirus Action Plan setting out how all four parts of the UK will take all necessary and reasonable steps to tackle this outbreak. The plan has four strands. Containing the virus, delaying its spread, researching its origins and cure, and finally mitigating the impact should the virus become more widespread. That is, contain, delay, research, mitigate. And let me be absolutely clear that for the overwhelming majority of people who contract the virus, this will be a mild disease from which they will speedily and fully recover as we’ve already seen. But I fully understand public concern, your concern, about the global spread of this virus. And it is highly likely that we will see a growing number of UK cases. And that’s why keeping the country safe is the government’s overriding priority. And our plan means we’re committed to doing everything possible based on the advice of our world leading scientific experts to prepare for all eventualities. Let’s not forget – we already have a fantastic NHS, fantastic testing systems and fantastic surveillance of the spread of disease. We will make sure the NHS gets all the support it needs to continue their brilliant response to the virus so far. The plan does not set out what the government will do, it sets out the steps we could take at the right time along the basis of the scientific advice. Our country remains extremely well prepared, as it has been since the outbreak began in Wuhan several months ago. Finally, crucially, we must not forget what we can all do to fight this virus, which is to wash our hands, you knew I was going to say this, but wash our hands with soap and water. And forgive me for repeating this but there will be people who will be tuning into this for the first time: wash your hands with soap and hot water for the length of time it takes to sing Happy Birthday twice. It’s simple advice but it’s the single most important thing we can do, as I think our experts would attest. But at this stage, and with the exception of all of the points I have just mentioned, I want to stress that for the vast majority of the people of this country, we should be going about our business as usual."
"Boris Johnson","COP26 President Alok Sharma's briefing to UN member states","6 March 2020","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/statement-by-business-secretary-and-cop26-president-alok-sharma-at-the-cop26-briefing-to-all-member-states-at-the-united-nations-new-york","Secretary-General, excellences, ladies and gentlemen, it is an honour to be here at the United Nations for my first international engagement as COP26 President. I would like to thank the Secretary-General for the great leadership he has shown in tackling climate change. I look forward to working with him and the wider UN team in the lead up to COP26. In my first 3 weeks as COP26 President I have met with the Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed, UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner, UNFCCC Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa. Other former COP Presidents, such as Laurent Fabius. Civil society organisations. Corporate leaders and finance executives. Encouragingly, there has been a strong level of agreement that we must act now to tackle climate change. Whilst in New York this has been further reinforced through my meetings with the permanent representatives of the Small Island Developing States, Least Developed Countries and others who are on the frontline of climate impacts. Failure to act, will cause irreversible consequences. As temperatures continue to rise, droughts and heatwaves will become more common. The risk of crops failing will increase. Sea levels will rise by anywhere between 1 to 3 feet by the end of this century. Hurricanes will become stronger and more intense. These events will put human life at risk. Lead to population displacement. It will devastate nature and biodiversity. And exact a catastrophic economic cost I do not need to tell many of you in this room what the impact to human life will be, because many of your countries are already living with the realities of climate change. Over the past 25 years an estimated 4.5 billion people have been affected by disasters, 90% of which have been caused by weather and climate related events. The UK first responders to Hurricane Dorian in the Bahamas last year described the scenes on the ground as apocalyptic. Roofs ripped from buildings, homes underwater, families left devastated by the loss of their loved ones. Sadly, this is a pattern we have seen over some time, and one which will accelerate unless we take action. As the representative of one of the Small Island Developing States I met yesterday said to me; Tackling climate change is an existential issue for us, if we do not get it right, we will no longer have a place to call home. Whether we live in the South or the North, the East or the West, we share one life-giving but fragile planet. And all our futures are intrinsically linked. COP26 can be a moment where the world comes together to ramp up momentum towards a climate-resilient, zero-carbon economy. Sending out a message of ambition and hope, that decarbonisation is the future, with huge opportunities for those who are willing to act now. And, of course, this transition must be fair and inclusive, leaving no-one behind. We all know that the current commitments made under the Paris Agreement fall far short of what is required. As the Secretary-General has said we must go further to limit warming to well below 2 degrees, whilst pursuing efforts to achieve 1.5 degrees. So, we want all countries to submit more ambitious Nationally Determined Contributions, committing to further cuts in carbon emissions by 2030. With all nations committing to reaching net zero emissions as soon as possible. I want to re-emphasise, this shift must be fair. The people most affected by climate change are those who have contributed the least and have the fewest resources to adapt. Developed countries must honour their commitments. Including meeting the 100-billion-dollar goal for climate finance. At COP26, the world must seek to agree a package which takes forward the Paris Agreement and powers the UN climate process onwards. We will seek to progress all issues mandated for discussion and I have already heard from many of the countries I have spoken to about their priorities for the negotiations. Ahead of the Summit, the UK with our partner Italy, will work not just with nations, but also cities, regions, companies, the Multilateral Development Banks, the Development Finance Institutions. And, very importantly, civil society in all its various forms. Yesterday I hosted a roundtable with a range of organisations and activists, including representatives from the Wildlife Conservation Society, the UN Foundation and Earth Rising founder Alexandria Villaseño. By uniting around specific issues, we can spur innovation, scale up solutions and bring down costs. And there are some areas which need particular action in 2020. First, adaptation and resilience. Helping people, economies and the environment adapt and prepare for the impacts of climate change. This was a personal priority for me when I was International Development Secretary. Working with Egypt and friends from Bangladesh, the Netherlands, Malawi and St Lucia here at the UN, we launched a Call for Action in this area where 118 nations and over 80 organisations committed to raising their ambition. I met with permanent representatives, the UN and NGOs this morning to discuss how we can translate these political commitments into on-the-ground action. We know it will be important to consider opportunities to improve responses to climate impacts and access to adaptation finance. Second, nature. Safeguarding ecosystems, protecting natural habitats and keeping carbon out of the atmosphere. A million animal and plant species are now threatened with extinction, more than ever before in human history. We cannot meet the temperature goals of the Paris Agreement or adapt the effects of climate change without restoring, protecting and enhancing nature. We have heard from you, I have heard from you, that there are opportunities to look at environmental regulation around supply chains and channel finance to invest in nature. The UN Oceans Conference in Lisbon, the 15th Conference on Biological Diversity hosted by China, and of course COP26, offer an opportunity to bend the curve of greenhouse gas emissions and biodiversity loss. And we will work with China, the United Nations and others to make sure that these global summits complement and support each other. Third, energy transition. Seizing the massive opportunities of cheaper renewables and storage. In the last few years, we have seen how alliances like ‘Powering Past Coal’ can drive momentum. In the UK the proportion of energy generated from coal has fallen from 40% in 2012 to 5% in 2018. We all need to invest in the innovation which will help us accelerate the transition to clean energy. But we also need to help empower developing countries to leapfrog the polluting options of the past and embrace the clean energy of the future. In my previous role as International Development Secretary, I saw fantastic examples of companies already doing this. A UK business called Azuri Technologies is providing solar energy systems to off-grid homes across Africa. This is a great example of existing opportunities that we need to scale up. Fourth, is accelerating the move to zero-carbon road transport. By 2040, over half of new car sales worldwide are projected to be electric. Yet to meet the Paris goals, this needs to happen faster. By working together, countries and industry can bring forward the date when zero-emissions vehicles will not only be cleaner, but also cheaper, than petrol and diesel. This will deliver benefits for the climate, and will help tackle air pollution which currently contributes to the death of an estimated 7 million people a year. And let me be clear, this is not about the UK pointing the finger, we know we also need to do more ourselves. That is why the UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced last month that we would bring forward a ban on selling new petrol, diesel or hybrid cars from 2040 to 2035. And this week as Business Secretary I announced a multi-million pound investment to design, test and manufacture electric machines in some of the UK’s most polluting industries. And lastly, we need to unleash the finance which will make all of this possible and power the shift to a zero carbon economy. From solar panels, to electric vehicles and tree planting, it is often finance that turns good intentions into action. The OECD estimates that we will need nearly 7 trillion dollars a year up to 2030 to meet the Paris Agreement, as well as the Sustainable Development Goals. Much of this funding needs will also need to come from the private sector. Whilst at the Department for International Development I set up the UK’s International Development Infrastructure Commission to help corral private sector money, alongside sovereign development funds, into sustainable infrastructure projects. Following the Commission’s recommendations, the UK is now partnering with Uganda, Egypt, Kenya, Ethiopia and Ghana, to design a new facility to plan, deliver and support funding to a range of infrastructure projects. Sustainability will be central to these projects, focusing on investments with low carbon emissions and infrastructure that will be resilient to a changing climate. As COP26 President, I will continue our efforts to mobilise finance for developing countries. Including asking others to make ambitious future international climate finance commitments. As the UK has done by doubling our contribution to £11.6 billion over the period from 2021 to 2025. The Multilateral Development Banks are the largest vehicle for channelling climate finance to developing countries. They will have a critical role to play, along with the development finance institutions, in the build up to COP26. But to move from billions to trillions, we will need all finance to align with the Paris Agreement. Making the spirit of Paris felt in London, New York, Frankfurt, Tokyo, Shanghai and every other financial centre. Last week, I joined the Governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, at the launch of the COP 26 Finance Action Plan. As Governor Carney noted, private finance is now increasingly focused on the opportunities and risks in the transition to a decarbonised economy. Every major systemic bank, the world’s largest insurers, its biggest pension funds and top asset managers are backing the Taskforce for Climate related Financial Disclosures. And this has been highlighted to me during the meetings I have had with leading financial organisations. Achieving net zero will require a whole economy transition. We have the opportunity to turn climate change into a growth opportunity for the global economy. In the UK, we have grown our economy by 75% since 1990 whilst cutting emissions by 43% showing, green growth is absolutely possible. While the list of initiatives I have outlined is not exhaustive, it gives an idea of the scale of the challenge before us. A challenge where we can only succeed together. As COP26 President I see my role as the custodian of a process. The UK and Italy will be co-hosting the summit, but success at this event will belong to the whole world. Alongside my Italian counterpart, we will work with you all to develop more ambitious plans on mitigation, adaptation and finance. Creating a drumbeat of action in the calendar of international events leading up to COP26. Last week, I had the opportunity to speak with one of my childhood heroes: the broadcaster and naturalist Sir David Attenborough. His message was simple. We must act now. Ladies and gentleman, each of us can help write our planet’s future. I have faith that working together with all of you in a collaborative manner, we will make the right choices. We owe that to ourselves. And to future generations. Thank you. Read the UN Secretary-General’s statement. Read Ambassador Zappia’s statement."
"Boris Johnson","Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 9 March 2020","9 March 2020","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-statement-on-coronavirus-9-march-2020","This morning I chaired a meeting of the government’s COBR emergency committee on the Coronavirus outbreak. The First Ministers of Scotland and Wales and the First Minister and deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland also attended and we agreed to continue to work closely in the weeks and months ahead. We received a detailed briefing from the Chief Medical Officer and the Chief Scientific Advisor. And again I repeat my gratitude to both Chris and to Patrick. There have now been four deaths from coronavirus in the UK, and our deepest sympathies are obviously with their friends and families. Our action plan as you know sets out the four phases of our approach to tackling the virus: Contain, Delay, Research, and Mitigate. We remain in the Contain phase of the outbreak, but watching what is happening around the world, our scientists think containment is extremely unlikely to work on its own, and that is why we are making extensive preparations for a move to the delay phase. We are preparing various actions to slow the spread of this disease in order to reduce the strain it places on the NHS. The more we can delay the peak of the spread to the summer, the better the NHS will be able to manage. Patrick and Chris will give you some more detailed information on the latest advice we are giving the public today - and how we expect that advice to change as the outbreak develops. As things stand I’m afraid it bears repeating that the best thing we can all do is wash our hands for 20 seconds with soap and water. We will also take questions, because I know there are lots of things the public want to hear from our advisors about. But before that I want to stress the following things: First, we are doing everything we can to combat this outbreak, based on the very latest scientific and medical advice. Second, we have a truly brilliant NHS, where staff have responded with all the determination, compassion and skill that makes their service so revered across the world. And they will continue to have this government’s full support, my support, in tackling this virus on the frontline. Third, we will set out further steps in the days and weeks ahead to help people protect themselves, their family and in particular the elderly and vulnerable. And finally, while it is absolutely critical, it’s absolutely critical in managing the spread of this virus that we take the right decisions at the right time, based on the latest and best evidence. So we must not do things which have no or limited medical benefit, nor things which could turn out to be counterproductive. There is no hiding from the fact that the coronavirus outbreak will present significant challenges for the UK, just as it does in other countries. But if we continue to look out for one another, to pull together in a united and national effort, I have no doubt that we can and will rise to that challenge. And I’m now going to ask Patrick and then Chris to give their own perspective on where we are."
"Boris Johnson","Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 12 March 2020","12 March 2020","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-statement-on-coronavirus-12-march-2020","Good afternoon everybody and thank you very much for coming. I’ve just chaired a meeting of the government’s emergency committee including ministers from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. And it’s clear that coronavirus, COVID-19, continues and will continue to spread across the world and our country over the next few months. We’ve done what can be done to contain this disease and this has bought us valuable time. But it is now a global pandemic. And the number of cases will rise sharply and indeed the true number of cases is higher - perhaps much higher - than the number of cases we have so far confirmed with tests. I’ve got to be clear, we’ve all got to be clear, that this is the worst public health crisis for a generation. Some people compare it to seasonal flu. Alas, that is not right. Owing to the lack of immunity, this disease is more dangerous. And it’s going to spread further and I must level with you, level with the British public, many more families are going to lose loved ones before their time. And the Chief Scientific Adviser will set out the best information we have on that in a moment. But as we’ve said over the last few weeks, we have a clear plan that we are now working through. And we are now moving to the next phase in that plan. Because this is now not just to attempt to contain the disease as far as possible, but to delay its spread and thereby minimise the suffering. If we delay the peak even by a few weeks, then our NHS will be in a stronger state as the weather improves and fewer people suffer from normal respiratory diseases, more beds are available and we’ll have more time for medical research. We can also act to stretch the peak of the disease over a longer period so that our society is better able to cope. The Chief Medical Officer will set out our lines of defence. We have to deploy these at the right time to maximise their effect. The most important task will be to protect our elderly and most vulnerable people during the peak weeks when there is the maximum risk of exposure to the disease and when the NHS will be under the most pressure. So the most dangerous period is not now but some weeks away depending on how fast it spreads. Today therefore we are moving forward with our plan. From tomorrow, if you have coronavirus symptoms, however mild – either a new continuous cough or a high temperature – then you should stay at home for at least 7 days to protect others and help slow the spread of the disease. We advise all those over 70 and those with serious medical conditions against going on cruises and we advise against international school trips. At some point in the next few weeks, we are likely to go further and if someone in a household has those symptoms, we will be asking everyone in the household to stay at home. We are not introducing this yet for reasons Sir Patrick will explain, but I want to signal now that this is coming down the track. We are considering the question of banning major public events such as sporting fixtures. The scientific advice as we’ve said over the last couple of weeks is that banning such events will have little effect on the spread. But there is also the issue of the burden that such events can place on public services. So we’re discussing these issues with colleagues in all parts of the United Kingdom and will have more to say shortly about the timing of further action in that respect. At all stages, we have been guided by the science, and we will do the right thing at the right time. We are not - repeat not - closing schools now. The scientific advice is that this could do more harm than good at this time. But we are of course keeping this under review and this again may change as the disease spreads. Schools should only close if they are specifically advised to do so. And that remains our advice. There is no escaping the reality that these measures will cause severe disruption across our country for many months. The best scientific advice is that this will help us slow the disease and save lives. There will be detailed information available on the NHS website and from 111 online. But I want to stress something that is very important in the wake of what we’re saying this afternoon – I urge people, who think in view of what we’re saying about their potential symptoms that they should stay at home, not to call 111 but to use the internet for information if they can. I also want at this stage to speak directly to older people. Because this disease is particularly dangerous for you, for older people, even though the vast majority this will be a mild to moderate illness, I know that many people will be very worried. And I think we should all be thinking about our elderly relatives, the more vulnerable members of their family, our neighbours, and everything we can do to protect them over the next few months. We’re going to need to mobilise millions of people to help and support each other. And I just want to you to know that the government will do all we can to help you and your family during this period. We’re not just going to be as you saw yesterday supporting the economy during this period, we will be providing money and many other forms of support, and helping communities to support each other. And as we have done over the last few weeks, we will continue to provide, as soon as we have it, as much clear scientific and medical information as we can. So I’d like to end by repeating the two important messages, with which you will have become familiar – it is still vital, perhaps more vital than ever – that we remember to wash our hands. And lastly of course even if things seem tough now, just to remember, that we will get through this, this country will get through this epidemic, just as it has got through many tougher experiences before if we look out for each other and commit wholeheartedly to a full national effort."
"Boris Johnson","Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 16 March 2020","16 March 2020","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-statement-on-coronavirus-16-march-2020","Good afternoon everybody, thank you very much for coming. I wanted to bring everyone up to date with the national fight back against the new coronavirus and the decisions that we’ve just taken in COBR for the whole of the UK. As we said last week, our objective is to delay and flatten the peak of the epidemic by bringing forward the right measures at the right time, so that we minimise suffering and save lives. And everything we do is based scrupulously on the best scientific advice. Last week we asked everyone to stay at home if you had one of two key symptoms: a high temperature or a new and continuous cough. Today, we need to go further, because according to SAGE [the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies] it looks as though we’re now approaching the fast growth part of the upward curve. And without drastic action, cases could double every 5 or 6 days. So, first, we need to ask you to ensure that if you or anyone in your household has one of those two symptoms, then you should stay at home for fourteen days. That means that if possible you should not go out even to buy food or essentials, other than for exercise, and in that case at a safe distance from others. If necessary, you should ask for help from others for your daily necessities. And if that is not possible, then you should do what you can to limit your social contact when you leave the house to get supplies. And even if you don’t have symptoms and if no one in your household has symptoms, there is more that we need you to do now. So, second, now is the time for everyone to stop non-essential contact with others and to stop all unnecessary travel. We need people to start working from home where they possibly can. And you should avoid pubs, clubs, theatres and other such social venues. It goes without saying, we should all only use the NHS when we really need to. And please go online rather than ringing NHS 111. Now, this advice about avoiding all unnecessary social contact, is particularly important for people over 70, for pregnant women and for those with some health conditions. And if you ask, why are we doing this now, why now, why not earlier, or later? Why bring in this very draconian measure? The answer is that we are asking people to do something that is difficult and disruptive of their lives. And the right moment, as we’ve always said, is to do it when it is most effective, when we think it can make the biggest difference to slowing the spread of the disease, reducing the number of victims, reducing the number of fatalities. And as we take these steps we should be focusing on the most vulnerable. So third, in a few days’ time – by this coming weekend – it will be necessary to go further and to ensure that those with the most serious health conditions are largely shielded from social contact for around 12 weeks. And again the reason for doing this in the next few days, rather than earlier or later, is that this is going to be very disruptive for people who have such conditions, and difficult for them, but, I believe, it’s now necessary. And we want to ensure that this period of shielding, this period of maximum protection coincides with the peak of the disease. And it’s now clear that the peak of the epidemic is coming faster in some parts of the country than in others. And it looks as though London is now a few weeks ahead. So, to relieve the pressure on the London health system and to slow the spread in London, it’s important that Londoners now pay special attention to what we are saying about avoiding non-essential contact, and to take particularly seriously the advice about working from home, and avoiding confined spaces such as pubs and restaurants. Lastly, it remains true as we have said in the last few weeks that risks of transmission of the disease at mass gatherings such as sporting events are relatively low. But obviously, logically as we advise against unnecessary social contact of all kinds, it is right that we should extend this advice to mass gatherings as well. And so we’ve also got to ensure that we have the critical workers we need, that might otherwise be deployed at those gatherings, to deal with this emergency. So from tomorrow, we will no longer be supporting mass gatherings with emergency workers in the way that we normally do. So mass gatherings, we are now moving emphatically away from. And I know that many people – including millions of fit and active people over 70 – may feel, listening to what I have just said, that there is something excessive about these measures. But I have to say, I believe that they are overwhelmingly worth it to slow the spread of the disease, to reduce the peak, to save life, minimise suffering and to give our NHS the chance to cope. Over the last few days, I have been comparing notes and talking to leaders around the world and I can tell you that the UK is now leading a growing global campaign amongst all our friends and allies, whether in the G7, the G20, the UN, the IMF – all those bodies in which we play a significant role. We’re leading a campaign to fight back against this disease. To keep the economy growing, to make sure that humanity has access to the drugs and the treatments that we all need, and the UK is also at the front of the effort to back business, to back our economy, to make sure that we get through it. I know that today we are asking a lot of everybody. It is far more now than just washing your hands - though clearly washing your hands remains important. But I can tell you that across this country, people and businesses in my experience are responding with amazing energy and creativity to the challenge that we face, and I want to thank everybody for the part that you are playing and are going to play."
"Boris Johnson","Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 17 March 2020","17 March 2020","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-statement-on-coronavirus-17-march-2020","I want to go through our overall plan for beating this new coronavirus. First, we must stop the disease spreading to a point where it overwhelms our NHS. Every country in the world has the same problem. This is a disease that is so dangerous and so infectious that without drastic measures to check its progress it would overwhelm any health system in the world. I have used the Italian health system, it is excellent, and the problem is not the health system, it’s the numbers of sufferance. That is why we announced the steps yesterday that we did – advising against all unnecessary contact – steps that are unprecedented since World War 2. They will have an effect on the spread of the disease. The shielding of vulnerable groups will also reduce suffering, and I want to thank everybody at this stage for what we’re all doing to follow this advice. I stress that although the measures announced are already extreme, we may well have to go further and faster in the coming days to protect lives and the NHS. Secondly, we are doing all we can and as quickly as we can to increase the capacity of the NHS. That means more testing, more beds, more ventilators and more trained staff. It means greater support for NHS and other staff. And it means much better data and much better technology. Third, we must do all we can to boost science and research. We must study this disease, test drugs that already exist and have been through medical trials to see what helps treat severe cases, and search for a vaccine. Fourth, we must act like any wartime government and do whatever it takes to support our economy. That’s the main purpose of this press conference this afternoon. We must support millions of businesses and tens of millions of families and individuals through the coming months. And to do that the government machine must and will respond with a profound sense of urgency. Thousands of brilliant officials are already working round the clock but we must do more and faster. The Chancellor will be saying much more about this in a moment, with further announcements in the coming days. Fifth, we will need to strengthen other public services that will be under great pressure from the direct and indirect effects of the disease, such as the effects of staff shortages, and from the economic pressures. All institutions will be under great pressure and we will therefore invest hugely in the people that we all rely on, and again I want to thank all our public servants for what they are already doing. Ultimately, to beat this crisis we will need a combination of better science, technology, medicine, data, government operations, economic support, learning from other countries and social support. As time goes on we will learn more and more about the disease and the effects of our actions. And while we need national unity, we also need international cooperation. And although we now need to impose physical distance between ourselves, we must at the same time have closer social support for each other. Yes this enemy can be deadly, but it is also beatable – and we know how to beat it and we know that if as a country we follow the scientific advice that is now being given we know that we will beat it. And however tough the months ahead we have the resolve and the resources to win the fight. And, to repeat, this government will do whatever it takes. I will now handover for more on that to Rishi Sunak, the Chancellor of the Exchequer."
"Boris Johnson","Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 18 March 2020","18 March 2020","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-statement-on-coronavirus-18-march-2020","Good afternoon. And thanks for coming or for indeed tuning in to these daily updates. I want to introduce, I’m sure you know Jenny Harries, Deputy Chief Medical Officer for England, and you know Sir Patrick Vallance, Chief Scientific Advisor. I want to tell you where we got to in our national fightback against the coronavirus. Today the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies met to discuss the latest evidence on the spread of the virus and the effects of the measures we have already taken to slow its spread. And Patrick is going to update us in a second about that. I want to repeat that everyone – everyone – must follow the advice to protect themselves and their families, but also – more importantly – to protect the wider public. So stay at home for seven days if you think you have the symptoms. Remember the two key symptoms are high temperature, a continuous new cough. Whole household to stay at home for 14 days if one member in that household thinks he/she has the symptoms. Avoid all unnecessary gatherings – pubs, clubs, bars, restaurants, theatres and so on and work from home if you can. Wash your hands. And we have already announced in the last few days we will massively scale up our testing capacity in the weeks ahead so we hit 25,000 tests a day. A huge public information campaign is being rolled out so people get all the information they need to protect themselves and others. We are asking retired healthcare professionals to come back and help us cope, help the NHS to cope, with this unprecedented challenge. And we will continue as we have from the beginning to do the right thing at the right time and to follow the best scientific advice. And we come today to the key issue of schools where we have been consistently advised that there is an important trade off. And so far the judgment of our advisers has been that closing schools is actually of limited value in slowing the spread of the epidemic. And that is partly because counterintuitively schools are actually very safe environments. And in this disease and epidemic children and young people are much less vulnerable. And hitherto the advice has been that we should keep schools open if possible in order to reduce the pressure on the NHS and on all other public services. But I think you’ll agree I have always been very clear that this is a balanced judgment and one that we have kept under constant review. So looking at the curve of the disease and looking at where we are now – we think now that we must apply downward pressure, further downward pressure on that upward curve by closing the schools. So I can announce today and Gavin Williamson making statement now in House of Commons that after schools shut their gates from Friday afternoon, they will remain closed for most pupils – for the vast majority of pupils- until further notice. I will explain what I mean by the vast majority of pupils. The objective is to slow the spread of the virus and we judge it is the right moment to do that. But of course, as I’ve always said, we also need to keep the NHS going and to treat the number of rising cases. So we need health workers who are also parents to continue to go to work. And we need other critical workers with children to keep doing their jobs too – from police officers who are keeping us safe to the supermarket delivery drivers, social care workers who look after the elderly and who are so vital. We will be setting out more details shortly about who we mean in these groups. So we therefore need schools to make provision for the children of these key workers who would otherwise be forced to stay home. And they will also need to look after the most vulnerable children. This will mean there will of course be are far fewer children in schools and that will help us to slow the spread of the disease. And these measures are crucial to make sure the critical parts of the economy keep functioning and public services keep functioning. So we are simultaneously asking nurseries and private schools to do the same, and we are providing financial support where it is needed. We are making provisions to supply meals and vouchers for children eligible for free school meals. And where some schools are already doing this, I want to make it clear we will reimburse the cost. And of course this does mean that exams will not take place as planned in May and June. Though we will make sure that pupils get the qualifications they need and deserve for their academic career. Now I know that these steps will not be easy for parents or teachers. And for many parents, this will be frustrating, and it will make it harder for them to go out to work. And of course that is one of the reasons we haven’t wanted to go ahead and that’s why we are working now on further measures to ensure that we support not just businesses but also individuals and their families to keep our economy going as Rishi Sunak the Chancellor outlined yesterday. I also need to remind parents that, as we have already advised, children should not be left with older grandparents, or older relatives, who may be particularly vulnerable or fall into some of the vulnerable groups and I know that will be difficult too. And I want to thank families for their sacrifice at this difficult time. I want to thank whole country for the efforts people are making to comply with these measures. I particularly want to thank the teachers, head teachers and all the support staff who keep schools going who will make these exceptional arrangements work, for the benefit of us all. By looking after the children of key workers they will be a critical part of our fightback against Coronavirus. As I have said, we will take the right steps at the right time, guided by the science. We believe the steps we have already taken, together with those I am announcing today, are already slowing the spread of the disease. But we will not hesitate to go further, and faster, in the days and weeks ahead. And we will do whatever it takes to so that we beat it together."
"Boris Johnson","Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 19 March 2020","19 March 2020","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-statement-on-coronavirus-19-march-2020","I want to begin by thanking everyone, by thanking you, in the media, and also thanking everyone for the huge efforts that the country is making to comply with the advice that we’ve been given And we’re asking such a huge amount, asking students to put their education on hold, we’re asking people not to socialise in the normal way And already we can see the impact that this is having on the UK economy and on business, on great, great companies And so it’s vital that we in Government stand behind them when what we are asking everyone to do is so crucial for saving literally thousands of lives by defeating this virus And I am conscious as the days have gone by that people will want to know how long we are expecting them to keep it up And I wanted to try to say something today about how I see the timescale of this campaign and where we’re going and what we need to do I do think, looking at it all, that we can turn the tide within the next 12 weeks And I am absolutely confident that we can send coronavirus packing in this country but only if we take the steps, we all take the steps we have outlined, And that is vital because that is how we are going to reduce the peak and once we’ve achieved that, and I think that we will, if take the steps that I have said, then the scientific progress that we’re making will really start to come into play and I wanted to discuss a little bit of that this afternoon with you because we are rapidly becoming so much better at understanding the genomics at the heart of this virus, a lot of that is going on in this country, we’re getting better at understanding the medicines that may treat and cure it And today we have put the first British corona patient into a randomised trial for drugs that may treat the disease UK experts and scientists expect to start trials for the first vaccine within a month And above all we are getting better at testing This crisis is so difficult because the enemy is invisible And the answer is to remove the cloak of invisibility And to identify the virus, and to be able to know which of us, is carrying it or who has actually had it and now got over it And to give you an idea of what is coming down the track We are in negotiations today to buy a so called antibody test As simple as a pregnancy test That could tell whether you have had the disease And it’s early days, but if it works as its proponents claim then we will buy literally hundreds of thousands of these kits as soon as practicable because obviously it has the potential to be a total gamechanger Because once you know that you have had it, you know that you are likely to be less vulnerable, you’re less likely to pass it on, and you can go back to work And of course by the same token we are massively increasing the testing to see whether you have it now And ramping up daily testing from 5000 a day to 10,000 to 25,000 and then up to 250,000 And that knowledge of where the virus is, will make a huge difference to our management of the disease and our ability to reduce disruption and economic difficulties And I wanted to set that out because this is rapidly coming down the track as I say, but it will take time to come on stream And that is why in the meantime, to get back to a theme that you know I’m going to repeat, it is absolutely vital that we follow the advice that we’ve been hearing over the last few days, The announcements we’ve already made about staying at home if you have the symptoms, if your family has the symptoms, about avoiding unnecessary contact Avoiding gatherings where you may pick up the disease pubs, bars, restaurants Please, please follow all that advice scrupulously Work from home if you possibly can Wash your hands, wash your hands And it’s by this combination of ruthless, determined, collective action and scientific progress that we’re already seeing that we will succeed And I know how difficult it may be, or it may seem right now, but if we do this together we will save, as I say, many many thousands of lives and to everybody in the UK, business world, everybody who is worried about their jobs, and everybody who faces difficulties because of the advice that we are giving, I say to business, stand by your employees, stand by your workers because we will stand by you And you’ll be hearing more about that in the course of the next day or so And that is how, by a mixture of determined, collective action and scientific progress, I have absolutely no doubt that we will turn the tide of this disease and beat it together."
"Boris Johnson","Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 20 March 2020","20 March 2020","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-statement-on-coronavirus-20-march-2020","Good afternoon and thank you for coming again, Today I am joined by the Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak and Jennie Harries deputy chief medical officer. Yesterday I set out the ambition of this government to turn the tide against coronavirus within 3 months. And I want to repeat that determination today. We are going to do it with testing. We are going to do it with new medicines, and with new digital technology that will help us to see the disease as it is transmitted, and thereby, by eliminating it, to stamp it out. And above all, now we are going to defeat this disease with a huge national effort to slow the spread by reducing unnecessary social contact. And I want to thank everyone for following the guidance we issued on Monday: to stay at home for 7 days if you think you have the symptoms, for 14 days if anyone in your household has either of the symptoms – a new continuous cough or a high temperature. To avoid pubs, bars, clubs and restaurants. To work from home if at all possible. Keep washing your hands. I know it has been tough. I know it has been inconvenient. But these actions that we’re all taking together are already helping to take the strain off our NHS. Bit by bit, day by day, by your actions, your restraint and your sacrifice, we are putting this country in a better and stronger position, where we will be able to save literally thousands of lives, of people of all ages, people who don’t deserve to die now. People whose lives can, must, and will be saved. And as we take these actions together and as we make these sacrifices, we can see the impact on the real economy. Already, fantastic British companies, already under huge strain, big and small. Workers who are finding that their jobs are under threat or are going, through no fault of their own. And to all of them, we in government say: We will stand by you. And I say that to companies, remember our joint objective: to beat this virus. And we will do everything in our power to help. And in just a minute, Rishi is going to explain how we are going to help workers of all kinds to get through this crisis, Supporting you directly in a way that Government has never been done before, in addition to the package we have already set out for business. And of course these measures are intended to be temporary and of course I am confident that, in time, the UK economy is going to bounce back. Of course it is. But I must be absolutely clear with you: the speed of that eventual recovery depends entirely on our ability, our collective ability, to get on top of the virus now. And that means we have to take the next steps, on scientific advice and following our plan, we are strengthening the measures announced on Monday which you will remember. And of course people have already made a huge effort to comply with those measures for avoiding unnecessary social contact. But we need now to push down further on that curve of transmission between us. And so following agreement between all the formations of the United Kingdom, all the devolved administrations, We are collectively telling, telling cafes, pubs, bars, restaurants to close tonight as soon as they reasonably can, and not to open tomorrow. Though to be clear, they can continue to provide take-out services. We’re also telling nightclubs, theatres, cinemas, gyms and leisure centres to close on the same timescale. Now, these are places where people come together, and indeed the whole purpose of these businesses is to bring people together. But the sad things is that today for now, at least physically, we need to keep people apart. And I want to stress that we will review the situation each month, to see if we can relax any of these measures. And listening to what I have just said, some people may of course be tempted to go out tonight. But please don’t. You may think you are invincible, but there is no guarantee you will get mild symptoms, and you can still be a carrier of the disease and pass it on to others So that’s why, as far as possible, we want you to stay at home, that’s how we can protect our NHS and save lives. To repeat, I know how difficult this is, how it seems to go against the freedom-loving instincts of the British people. And I also know much, right now, workers and business deserve the financial reassurance we are giving them. But we will get through this. We will get through it together, and we will beat this virus. And to ram that point home: the more effectively we follow the advice that we are given, the faster this country will stage both a medical and an economic recovery in full."
"Boris Johnson","PM Mother's Day words: 22 March 2020","22 March 2020","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-mothers-day-words-22-march-2020","Today is Mother’s Day. It is a day when we celebrate the sacrifice and the effort of those who gave us life, and across the country I know that millions of people will have been preparing to do something special; not just a card, not just flowers. I know that everyone’s strongest instinct is to go and see their mothers in person, to have a meal together, to show them how much you love them. But I am afraid that this Mothering Sunday the single best present that we can give – we who owe our mothers so much – is to spare them the risk of catching a very dangerous disease. The sad news is that means staying away. This time the best thing is to ring her, video call her, Skype her, but to avoid any unnecessary physical contact or proximity. And why? Because if your mother is elderly or vulnerable, then I am afraid all the statistics show that she is much more likely to die from coronavirus, or Covid-19. We cannot disguise or sugar coat the threat. The numbers are very stark, and they are accelerating. We are only a matter of weeks – two or three – behind Italy. The Italians have a superb health care system. And yet their doctors and nurses have been completely overwhelmed by the demand. The Italian death toll is already in the thousands and climbing. Unless we act together, unless we make the heroic and collective national effort to slow the spread – then it is all too likely that our own NHS will be similarly overwhelmed. That is why this country has taken the steps that it has, in imposing restrictions never seen before either in peace or war. We have closed the schools, the pubs, the bars, the restaurants, the gyms, and we are asking people to stay and work at home if they possibly can. In order to help businesses and workers through the crisis, we have come up with unprecedented packages of support. All of this is putting our country, and our society, under enormous strain. But already this crisis is also bringing out the best in us all – in the army of volunteers that has sprung up to help the vulnerable, in the millions of acts of kindness; in the work of all the people who are continuing to provide essential services, from transport workers to supermarket staff to health and social care workers. Yes, this disease is forcing us apart – at least physically. But this epidemic is also the crucible in which we are already forging new bonds of togetherness and altruism and sharing. This country will be changed by coronavirus, but there is every reason to think we will come through it stronger and better than ever before. And the more effectively we follow the medical advice, the faster we will bounce back to health – medically and economically. So this Mothering Sunday let’s all do everything we can to show our respect and love to those who gave us life – and minimise the risk to their own lives. Bit by bit, day by day, we are all helping to delay the spread of the disease, and to give our amazing NHS staff the time to prepare for the peak. So let’s follow the advice, stay home this Mothering Sunday. Send her your love by phone or skype. Let’s stay at home, protect our NHS, and together we will save literally thousands of lives."
"Boris Johnson","Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 22 March 2020","22 March 2020","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-statement-on-coronavirus-22-march-2020","Good afternoon everyone Thank you for coming, and thank you to Robert Jenrick, the Communities Secretary, and Dr Jenny Harries, the Deputy Chief Medical Officer. I want again to thank everyone in the country today for the huge effort that we are collectively making. I want to thank the amazing workers in the NHS, everybody working in social care, in every sector, in food distribution, transport, you name it – absolutely everyone who is keeping this country going today. And I want to thank everyone who is being forced to do something differently today. Everyone who didn’t visit their mum for Mother’s Day but Facetimed them, Skyped them, rang them instead. Thank you for your restraint and for what you did. Everyone who was forced to close a pub or a restaurant or a gym or any other business that could have done fantastic businesses on a great day like this. Thank you for your sacrifice, I know how tough it must be. And I can tell you again that this government will be standing behind you – behind British business, behind British workers, employees, self-employed – throughout this crisis. And the reason we are taking these unprecedented steps to prop up businesses, support businesses and support our economy and these preventative measures is because we have to slow the spread of the disease and to save thousands of lives. Today we have come to the stage of our plan that I advertised at the outset, when we first set out the plan of the UK government. When we have to take special steps to protect the particularly vulnerable. I said the moment would come where we needed to shield those with serious conditions. There are probably about 1.5 million in all. And in a minute Robert Jenrick will set out the plan in detail. But this shielding will do more than any other single measure that we are setting out to save life. That is what we want to do. Also to reduce infection and to slow the spread of the disease. We have to do more to make sure that the existing measures that we are taking are having the effect that we want. So it is crucial that people understand tomorrow that the schools are closed. And tomorrow you should not send your child to school unless you have been identified as a key worker. And more generally in the view of the way people have responded over the last few days to the measures we have set out I want to say a bit more about how we interact outdoors. Of course I want people to be able to go to the parks and open spaces and to enjoy themselves – it is crucial for health and mental and physical wellbeing. But please follow the advice and don’t think that fresh air in itself automatically provides some immunity. You have to stay two metres apart; you have to follow the social distancing advice. And even if you think you are personally invulnerable, there are plenty of people you can infect and whose lives will then be put at risk. And I say this now – on Sunday evening – take this advice seriously, follow it, because it is absolutely crucial. And as I have said throughout this process we will keep the implementation of these measures under constant review and, yes of course, we will bring forward further measures if we think that is necessary. Always remember that in following this advice- and I know how difficult that is – that each and every one of us. You are doing your bit in following this advice to slow the spread of this disease. The more we collectively slow the spread, the more time we give the NHS to prepare, the more lives we will save, the faster we will get through this. And always remember – we will get through this, and we will beat it together. Next Robert Jenrick to outline the shielding measures."
"Boris Johnson","Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 23 March 2020","23 March 2020","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-address-to-the-nation-on-coronavirus-23-march-2020","Good Evening, The coronavirus is the biggest threat this country has faced for decades – and this country is not alone. All over the world we are seeing the devastating impact of this invisible killer. And so tonight I want to update you on the latest steps we are taking to fight the disease and what you can do to help. And I want to begin by reminding you why the UK has been taking the approach that we have. Without a huge national effort to halt the growth of this virus, there will come a moment when no health service in the world could possibly cope; because there won’t be enough ventilators, enough intensive care beds, enough doctors and nurses. And as we have seen elsewhere, in other countries that also have fantastic health care systems, that is the moment of real danger. To put it simply, if too many people become seriously unwell at one time, the NHS will be unable to handle it - meaning more people are likely to die, not just from Coronavirus but from other illnesses as well. So it’s vital to slow the spread of the disease. Because that is the way we reduce the number of people needing hospital treatment at any one time, so we can protect the NHS’s ability to cope - and save more lives. And that’s why we have been asking people to stay at home during this pandemic. And though huge numbers are complying - and I thank you all - the time has now come for us all to do more. From this evening I must give the British people a very simple instruction - you must stay at home. Because the critical thing we must do is stop the disease spreading between households. That is why people will only be allowed to leave their home for the following very limited purposes: shopping for basic necessities, as infrequently as possible one form of exercise a day - for example a run, walk, or cycle - alone or with members of your household; any medical need, to provide care or to help a vulnerable person; and travelling to and from work, but only where this is absolutely necessary and cannot be done from home. That’s all - these are the only reasons you should leave your home. You should not be meeting friends. If your friends ask you to meet, you should say No. You should not be meeting family members who do not live in your home. You should not be going shopping except for essentials like food and medicine - and you should do this as little as you can. And use food delivery services where you can. If you don’t follow the rules the police will have the powers to enforce them, including through fines and dispersing gatherings. To ensure compliance with the Government’s instruction to stay at home, we will immediately: close all shops selling non-essential goods, including clothing and electronic stores and other premises including libraries, playgrounds and outdoor gyms, and places of worship; we will stop all gatherings of more than two people in public – excluding people you live with; and we’ll stop all social events, including weddings, baptisms and other ceremonies, but excluding funerals. Parks will remain open for exercise but gatherings will be dispersed. No Prime Minister wants to enact measures like this. I know the damage that this disruption is doing and will do to people’s lives, to their businesses and to their jobs. And that’s why we have produced a huge and unprecedented programme of support both for workers and for business. And I can assure you that we will keep these restrictions under constant review. We will look again in three weeks, and relax them if the evidence shows we are able to. But at present there are just no easy options. The way ahead is hard, and it is still true that many lives will sadly be lost. And yet it is also true that there is a clear way through. Day by day we are strengthening our amazing NHS with 7500 former clinicians now coming back to the service. With the time you buy - by simply staying at home - we are increasing our stocks of equipment. We are accelerating our search for treatments. We are pioneering work on a vaccine. And we are buying millions of testing kits that will enable us to turn the tide on this invisible killer. I want to thank everyone who is working flat out to beat the virus. Everyone from the supermarket staff to the transport workers to the carers to the nurses and doctors on the frontline. But in this fight we can be in no doubt that each and every one of us is directly enlisted. Each and every one of us is now obliged to join together. To halt the spread of this disease. To protect our NHS and to save many many thousands of lives. And I know that as they have in the past so many times. The people of this country will rise to that challenge. And we will come through it stronger than ever. We will beat the coronavirus and we will beat it together. And therefore I urge you at this moment of national emergency to stay at home, protect our NHS and save lives. Thank you."

I am joined once again by our Chief Medical Officer, Professor Chris Whitty, and the Chief Scientific Advisor, Sir Patrick Vallance. From the very beginning of this crisis I have followed the advice of our world-leading scientists. To defeat coronavirus by taking the right measures at the right time. What everyone needs to recognise is that our NHS – like any world-class health service – has only limited numbers of doctors, nurses and specialist equipment. So, the more people who become sick at any one time, the harder it is for the NHS to cope. And so it is vital to delay the spread of the disease and reduce the number of people needing hospital treatment at any one time. That is why we have given the clear instruction that people must stay at home – unless they have one of the reasons we have set out. And, with your help we will slow the spread of the disease. I want to thank everyone who has been following the clear rules that we set out on Monday. And I want to thank everyone in the NHS, the front line of the fight against coronavirus. And of course all our public services. Our teachers and our school staff, the transport workers, police officers, And everyone who is keeping this country going. But I also want to offer a special thank you to everyone who has now volunteered to help the NHS. When we launched the appeal last night we hoped to get 250,000 over a few days. But I can tell you that in just 24 hours 405,000 people have responded to the call. They will be driving medicines from pharmacies to patients. They will be bringing patients home from hospital. Very importantly they’ll be making regular phone calls to check on and support people who are staying on their own at home. And they will be absolutely crucial in the fight against this virus. That is already – in one day – as many volunteers as the population of Coventry. And so, to all of you, and to all the former NHS staff who are coming back now into the service. I say thank you on behalf of the entire country. Now I want to take some questions but finally I want to remind everyone of our core policy: Stay at home Protect the NHS And save lives."
"Boris Johnson","PM video message on coronavirus: 27 March 2020","27 March 2020","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-video-message-on-coronavirus-27-march-2020","Hi folks. I want to bring you up to speed on something that’s happening today which is that I’ve developed mild symptoms of the coronavirus. That’s to say – a temperature and a persistent cough. And, on the advice of the Chief Medical Officer, I’ve taken a test. That has come out positive. So I am working from home. I’m self-isolating. And that’s entirely the right thing to do. But be in no doubt that I can continue, thanks to the wizardry of modern technology, to communicate with all my top team to lead the national fightback against coronavirus. And I want to thank everybody who’s involved, I want to thank, above all, our amazing NHS staff. It was very moving last night to join in that national clap for the NHS. But it’s not just the NHS, it’s our police, our social care workers, teachers, everybody who works in schools, DWP staff. An amazing national effort by the public services. But also by every member of the British public who’s volunteering, an incredible response – 600,000 people have volunteered to take part in a great national effort to protect people from the consequences of coronavirus – I want to thank you. I want to thank everybody who’s working to keep our country going through this epidemic. And we will get through it. And the way we’re going to get through it is, of course, by applying the measures that you’ll have heard so much about. And the more effectively we all comply with those measures, the faster our country will come through this epidemic and the faster we’ll bounce back. So thank you to everybody who’s doing what I’m doing, working from home, to stop the spread of the virus from household to household. That’s the way we’re going to win, we’re going to beat it, and we’re going to beat it together. Stay at home, protect the NHS, and save lives."
"Boris Johnson","PM statement in Downing Street: 27 April 2020","27 April 2020","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-statement-in-downing-street-27-april-2020","I am sorry I have been away from my desk for much longer than I would have liked and I want to thank everybody who has stepped up in particular the First Secretary of State Dominic Raab who has done a terrific job but once again I want to thank you the people of this country for the sheer grit and guts you have shown and are continuing to show every day I know that this virus brings new sadness and mourning to households across the land and it is still true that this is the biggest single challenge this country has faced since the war and I in no way minimise the continuing problems we face and yet it is also true that we are making progress with fewer hospital admissions fewer covid patients in ICU and real signs now that we are passing through the peak and thanks to your forbearance, your good sense, your altruism, your spirit of community thanks to our collective national resolve we are on the brink of achieving that first clear mission to prevent our national health service from being overwhelmed in a way that tragically we have seen elsewhere and that is how and why we are now beginning to turn the tide If this virus were a physical assailant an unexpected and invisible mugger which I can tell you from personal experience it is then this is the moment when we have begun together to wrestle it to the floor and so it follows that this is the moment of opportunity this is the moment when we can press home our advantage it is also the moment of maximum risk because I know that there will be many people looking now at our apparent success and beginning to wonder whether now is the time to go easy on those social distancing measures and I know how hard and how stressful it has been to give up even temporarily those ancient and basic freedoms not seeing friends, not seeing loved ones working from home, managing the kids worrying about your job and your firm so let me say directly also to British business to the shopkeepers, to the entrepreneurs, to the hospitality sector to everyone on whom our economy depends I understand your impatience I share your anxiety And I know that without our private sector without the drive and commitment of the wealth creators of this country there will be no economy to speak of there will be no cash to pay for our public services no way of funding our NHS and yes I can see the long term consequences of lock down as clearly as anyone and so yes I entirely share your urgency it’s the government’s urgency and yet we must also recognise the risk of a second spike the risk of losing control of that virus and letting the reproduction rate go back over one because that would mean not only a new wave of death and disease but also an economic disaster and we would be forced once again to slam on the brakes across the whole country and the whole economy and reimpose restrictions in such a way as to do more and lasting damage and so I know it is tough and I want to get this economy moving as fast as I can but I refuse to throw away all the effort and the sacrifice of the British people and to risk a second major outbreak and huge loss of life and the overwhelming of the NHS and I ask you to contain your impatience because I believe we are coming now to the end of the first phase of this conflict and in spite of all the suffering we have so nearly succeeded we defied so many predictions we did not run out of ventilators or ICU beds we did not allow our NHS to collapse and on the contrary we have so far collectively shielded our NHS so that our incredible doctors and nurses and healthcare staff have been able to shield all of us from an outbreak that would have been far worse and we collectively flattened the peak and so when we are sure that this first phase is over and that we are meeting our five tests deaths falling NHS protected rate of infection down really sorting out the challenges of testing and PPE avoiding a second peak then that will be the time to move on to the second phase in which we continue to suppress the disease and keep the reproduction rate, the r rate, down, but begin gradually to refine the economic and social restrictions and one by one to fire up the engines of this vast UK economy and in that process difficult judgments will be made and we simply cannot spell out now how fast or slow or even when those changes will be made though clearly the government will be saying much more about this in the coming days and I want to serve notice now that these decisions will be taken with the maximum possible transparency and I want to share all our working and our thinking, my thinking, with you the British people and of course, we will be relying as ever on the science to inform us as we have from the beginning but we will also be reaching out to build the biggest possible consensus across business, across industry, across all parts of our United Kingdom across party lines bringing in opposition parties as far as we possibly can because I think that is no less than what the British people would expect and I can tell you now that preparations are under way and have been for weeks to allow us to win phase two of this fight as I believe we are now on track to prevail in phase one and so I say to you finally if you can keep going in the way that you have kept going so far if you can help protect our NHS to save lives and if we as a country can show the same spirit of optimism and energy shown by Captain Tom Moore who turns 100 this week if we can show the same spirit of unity and determination as we have all shown in the past six weeks then I have absolutely no doubt that we will beat it together we will come through this all the faster and the United Kingdom will emerge stronger than ever before"
"Boris Johnson","Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 10 May 2020","10 May 2020","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-address-to-the-nation-on-coronavirus-10-may-2020","Prime Minister Boris Johnson has addressed the nation on coronavirus. It is now almost two months since the people of this country began to put up with restrictions on their freedom – your freedom – of a kind that we have never seen before in peace or war. And you have shown the good sense to support those rules overwhelmingly. You have put up with all the hardships of that programme of social distancing. Because you understand that as things stand, and as the experience of every other country has shown, it’s the only way to defeat the coronavirus - the most vicious threat this country has faced in my lifetime. And though the death toll has been tragic, and the suffering immense. And though we grieve for all those we have lost. It is a fact that by adopting those measures we prevented this country from being engulfed by what could have been a catastrophe in which the reasonable worst case scenario was half a million fatalities. And it is thanks to your effort and sacrifice in stopping the spread of this disease that the death rate is coming down and hospital admissions are coming down. And thanks to you we have protected our NHS and saved many thousands of lives. And so I know - you know - that it would be madness now to throw away that achievement by allowing a second spike. We must stay alert. We must continue to control the virus and save lives. And yet we must also recognise that this campaign against the virus has come at colossal cost to our way of life. We can see it all around us in the shuttered shops and abandoned businesses and darkened pubs and restaurants. And there are millions of people who are both fearful of this terrible disease, and at the same time also fearful of what this long period of enforced inactivity will do to their livelihoods and their mental and physical wellbeing. To their futures and the futures of their children. So I want to provide tonight - for you - the shape of a plan to address both fears. Both to beat the virus and provide the first sketch of a road map for reopening society. A sense of the way ahead, and when and how and on what basis we will take the decisions to proceed. I will be setting out more details in Parliament tomorrow and taking questions from the public in the evening. I have consulted across the political spectrum, across all four nations of the UK. And though different parts of the country are experiencing the pandemic at different rates. And though it is right to be flexible in our response. I believe that as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom – Scotland, England, Wales, Northern Ireland, there is a strong resolve to defeat this together. And today a general consensus on what we could do. And I stress could. Because although we have a plan, it is a conditional plan. And since our priority is to protect the public and save lives, we cannot move forward unless we satisfy the five tests. We must protect our NHS. We must see sustained falls in the death rate. We must see sustained and considerable falls in the rate of infection. We must sort out our challenges in getting enough PPE to the people who need it, and yes, it is a global problem but we must fix it. And last, we must make sure that any measures we take do not force the reproduction rate of the disease - the R - back up over one, so that we have the kind of exponential growth we were facing a few weeks ago. And to chart our progress and to avoid going back to square one, we are establishing a new Covid Alert System run by a new Joint Biosecurity Centre. And that Covid Alert Level will be determined primarily by R and the number of coronavirus cases. And in turn that Covid Alert Level will tell us how tough we have to be in our social distancing measures – the lower the level the fewer the measures. The higher the level, the tougher and stricter we will have to be. There will be five alert levels. Level One means the disease is no longer present in the UK and Level Five is the most critical – the kind of situation we could have had if the NHS had been overwhelmed. Over the period of the lockdown we have been in Level Four, and it is thanks to your sacrifice we are now in a position to begin to move in steps to Level Three. And as we go everyone will have a role to play in keeping the R down. By staying alert and following the rules. And to keep pushing the number of infections down there are two more things we must do. We must reverse rapidly the awful epidemics in care homes and in the NHS, and though the numbers are coming down sharply now, there is plainly much more to be done. And if we are to control this virus, then we must have a world-beating system for testing potential victims, and for tracing their contacts. So that – all told - we are testing literally hundreds of thousands of people every day. We have made fast progress on testing – but there is so much more to do now, and we can. When this began, we hadn’t seen this disease before, and we didn’t fully understand its effects. With every day we are getting more and more data. We are shining the light of science on this invisible killer, and we will pick it up where it strikes. Because our new system will be able in time to detect local flare-ups – in your area – as well as giving us a national picture. And yet when I look at where we are tonight, we have the R below one, between 0.5 and 0.9 – but potentially only just below one. And though we have made progress in satisfying at least some of the conditions I have given. We have by no means fulfilled all of them. And so no, this is not the time simply to end the lockdown this week. Instead we are taking the first careful steps to modify our measures. And the first step is a change of emphasis that we hope that people will act on this week. We said that you should work from home if you can, and only go to work if you must. We now need to stress that anyone who can’t work from home, for instance those in construction or manufacturing, should be actively encouraged to go to work. And we want it to be safe for you to get to work. So you should avoid public transport if at all possible – because we must and will maintain social distancing, and capacity will therefore be limited. So work from home if you can, but you should go to work if you can’t work from home. And to ensure you are safe at work we have been working to establish new guidance for employers to make workplaces COVID-secure. And when you do go to work, if possible do so by car or even better by walking or bicycle. But just as with workplaces, public transport operators will also be following COVID-secure standards. And from this Wednesday, we want to encourage people to take more and even unlimited amounts of outdoor exercise. You can sit in the sun in your local park, you can drive to other destinations, you can even play sports but only with members of your own household. You must obey the rules on social distancing and to enforce those rules we will increase the fines for the small minority who break them. And so every day, with ever increasing data, we will be monitoring the R and the number of new infections, and the progress we are making, and if we as a nation begin to fulfil the conditions I have set out, then in the next few weeks and months we may be able to go further. In step two – at the earliest by June 1 – after half term – we believe we may be in a position to begin the phased reopening of shops and to get primary pupils back into schools, in stages, beginning with reception, Year 1 and Year 6. Our ambition is that secondary pupils facing exams next year will get at least some time with their teachers before the holidays. And we will shortly be setting out detailed guidance on how to make it work in schools and shops and on transport. And step three - at the earliest by July - and subject to all these conditions and further scientific advice; if and only if the numbers support it, we will hope to re-open at least some of the hospitality industry and other public places, provided they are safe and enforce social distancing. Throughout this period of the next two months we will be driven not by mere hope or economic necessity. We are going to be driven by the science, the data and public health. And I must stress again that all of this is conditional, it all depends on a series of big Ifs. It depends on all of us – the entire country – to follow the advice, to observe social distancing, and to keep that R down. And to prevent re-infection from abroad, I am serving notice that it will soon be the time – with transmission significantly lower – to impose quarantine on people coming into this country by air. And it is because of your efforts to get the R down and the number of infections down here, that this measure will now be effective. And of course we will be monitoring our progress locally, regionally, and nationally and if there are outbreaks, if there are problems, we will not hesitate to put on the brakes. We have been through the initial peak – but it is coming down the mountain that is often more dangerous. We have a route, and we have a plan, and everyone in government has the all-consuming pressure and challenge to save lives, restore livelihoods and gradually restore the freedoms that we need. But in the end this is a plan that everyone must make work. And when I look at what you have done already. The patience and common sense you have shown. The fortitude of the elderly whose isolation we all want to end as fast as we can. The incredible bravery and hard work of our NHS staff, our care workers. The devotion and self-sacrifice of all those in every walk of life who are helping us to beat this disease. Police, bus drivers, train drivers, pharmacists, supermarket workers, road hauliers, bin collectors, cleaners, security guards, postal workers, our teachers and a thousand more. The scientists who are working round the clock to find a vaccine. When I think of the millions of everyday acts of kindness and thoughtfulness that are being performed across this country. And that have helped to get us through this first phase. I know that we can use this plan to get us through the next. And if we can’t do it by those dates, and if the alert level won’t allow it, we will simply wait and go on until we have got it right. We will come back from this devilish illness. We will come back to health, and robust health. And though the UK will be changed by this experience, I believe we can be stronger and better than ever before. More resilient, more innovative, more economically dynamic, but also more generous and more sharing. But for now we must stay alert, control the virus and save lives. Thank you very much."
"Boris Johnson","Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 11 May 2020","11 May 2020","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-statement-on-coronavirus-11-may-2020","Coronavirus press conference 11 May 2020 Good evening and thank you for joining us for this Downing Street press conference. First of all, I want to update you on the latest data in our fight against coronavirus. I can report through the Government’s ongoing testing and monitoring programme that, as of today: 1,921,770 tests for coronavirus have now been carried out in the UK, including 100,490 tests carried out yesterday; 223,060 people have tested positive, that’s an increase of 3,877 cases since yesterday; 11,401 people are currently in hospital with coronavirus, down from 11,768 the previous day. And sadly, of those tested positive for coronavirus, across all settings, 32,065 have now died. That’s an increase of 210 fatalities since yesterday. This figure includes deaths in all settings not just in hospitals. Before we begin questions from the public and from the media I just want to remind people of a number of important things I said in my address to the nation last night. First, in order to monitor our progress, we are establishing a new COVID Alert Level System. The COVID Alert Level has five levels, each relating to the level of threat posed by the virus. The level will be primarily determined by the R value and the number of coronavirus cases. In turn, that COVID Alert Level will determine the level of social distancing measures in place. The lower the level the fewer the measures; the higher the level the stricter the measures. Throughout the period of lockdown which started on March 23rd we have been at Level 4 – meaning a Covid19 epidemic is in general circulation, and transmission is high or rising exponentially. Thanks to the hard work and sacrifices of the British people in this lockdown, we have helped to bring the R level down and we are now in a position to begin moving to Level 3, in steps. And we have set out the first of three steps we will take to carefully modify the measures, gradually ease the lockdown, and begin to allow people to return to their way of life - but crucially while avoiding what would be a disastrous second peak that overwhelms the NHS. After each step we will closely monitor the impact of that step on the R and the number of infections, and all the available data, and we will only take the next step when we are satisfied that it is safe to do so. Step 1 - from this week: Those who cannot work from home should now speak to their employer about going back to work. You can now spend time outdoors and exercise as often as you like. You can meet one person outside of your household outside (outdoors), provided you stay 2 metres apart. The social distancing measures remain absolutely crucial to us keeping the infection rate and the number of cases down as low as we possibly can. Step 2 - from June 1, at the earliest, as long as the data allows, we aim to allow: Primary schools to reopen for some pupils, in smaller class sizes; Non-essential retail to start to reopen, when and where it is safe to do so; Cultural and sporting events to take place behind closed doors, without crowds. And then Step 3 – no earlier than July 4, and again, only if the data says it safe, we aim to allow: More businesses and premises to open, including potentially those offering personal care such as leisure facilities, public places, and places of worship. Many of these businesses will need to operate in new ways to ensure they are safe, and we will work with these sectors on how to do this. So, given we have taken the first step in carefully adjusting some of the measures today, and therefore our advice to people on what to do, we have also updated our messaging. We are now asking people to Stay Alert, Control the Virus and Save Lives. Yes - staying alert, for the vast majority of people, still means staying at home as much as possible. But there are a range of other actions we’re advising people to take as we modify measures. People should Stay Alert, by: working from home if you can; limiting contact with other people; keeping distance if you go out - 2 metres apart where possible; washing your hands regularly; wearing a face covering when you are in enclosed spaces where it’s difficult to be socially distant - for example in some shops and on public transport; and if you or anyone in your household has symptoms, you all need to self-isolate. Because if everyone stays alert and follows the rules, we can control coronavirus by keeping the R down and reducing the number of infections. This is how we can continue to save lives, and livelihoods, as we begin as a nation to recover from coronavirus."
"Boris Johnson","PM statement in the House of Commons: 11 May 2020","11 May 2020","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-statement-in-the-house-of-commons-11-may-2020","Mr Speaker, with permission, I will make a statement about the next steps in our battle against coronavirus, and how we can, with the utmost caution, gradually begin to rebuild our economy and reopen our society. For the last two months, the British people have faced a grave threat with common sense, compassion and unflinching resolve. We have together observed the toughest restrictions on our freedoms in memory, changing our way of life on a scale unimaginable only months ago. All our efforts have been directed towards protecting our NHS and saving lives. Tragically, many families have lost loved ones before their time and we share their grief. Yet our shared effort has averted a still worse catastrophe, one that could have overwhelmed the NHS and claimed half a million lives. Every day, dedicated doctors, nurses, and social care workers, army medics and more have risked their own lives in the service of others, they have helped to cut the Reproduction rate from between 2.6 and 2.8 in April to between 0.5 and 0.9 today. The number of covid patients in hospital has fallen by over a third since Easter Sunday. Our armed forces joined our NHS to build new hospitals on timetables that were telescoped from years to weeks, almost doubling the number of critical care beds, and ensuring that since the end of March, at least a third have always been available. Our challenge now is to find a way forward that preserves our hard won gains, while easing the burden of the lockdown. And I will be candid with the House: this is a supremely difficult balance to strike. There could be no greater mistake than to jeopardise everything we have striven to achieve by proceeding too far and too fast. We will be driven not by hope or economic revival as an end in itself, but by data, and science and public health. And so the Government is submitting to the House today a plan which is conditional and dependent as always on the common sense and observance of the British people, and on continual re-assessment of the data. That picture varies across the regions and Home Nations of the United Kingdom, requiring a flexible response. Different parts of the UK may need to stay in full lockdown longer but any divergence should only be short-term because as Prime Minister of the UK, I am in no doubt that we must defeat this threat and face the challenge of recovery together. Our progress will depend on meeting five essential tests: protecting the NHS, reducing both the daily death toll and the infection rate in a sustained way,ensuring that testing and PPE can meet future demand - a global problem, but one that we must fix, and avoiding a second peak that would overwhelm the NHS. A new UK-wide Joint Biosecurity Centre will measure our progress with a five-stage Covid Alert System, and the combined effect of our measures so far has been to prevent us from reaching Level Five, a situation that would have seen the NHS overwhelmed, and to hold us at Level Four. Thanks to the hard work and sacrifice of the British people by following the social distancing rules, we are now in a position where we can move in stages to where I hope the scientific advice will tell us that we are down to Level Three. But this will only happen if everyone continues to play their part, to stay alert and to follow the rules. We must also deal with the epidemic in care homes, where a tragic number of the elderly and vulnerable have been lost and while the situation is thankfully improving, there is a vast amount more to be done. And of course we need a world-leading system for testing and tracking and tracing victims and their contacts so I’m delighted that Baroness Harding, the chair of NHS Improvement, has agreed to take charge of a programme that will ultimately enable us to test hundreds of thousands of people every day. All this means we have begun our descent from the peak of the epidemic, but our journey has reached the most perilous moment where a wrong move could be disastrous. So at this stage, we can go no further than to announce the first careful modifications of our measures, Step 1 in moving towards Covid Alert Level 3, a shift in emphasis that we can begin this week. Anyone who cannot work from home should be actively encouraged to go to work. And sectors that are allowed to be open should indeed be open, but subject to social distancing. These include food production, construction, manufacturing, logistics, distribution, scientific research. And to support this, to explain this again, we are publishing guidance for businesses on how to make these workplaces safe. Covid secure. People who are able to work from home, as we’ve continually said, should continue to do so, and people who cannot work from home should talk to their employers about returning this week and the difficulties they may or may not have. Anyone with covid symptoms obviously – or in a household where someone else has symptoms – should self-isolate. We want everyone travelling to work to be safe, so people should continue to avoid public transport wherever possible because we must maintain social distancing which will inevitably limit capacity. Instead people should drive or better still walk or cycle. With more activity outside our homes, we would now advise people to wear a cloth face covering in enclosed spaces where social distancing is not always possible, and you are more likely to come in contact with people you do not normally meet. The reason is face coverings can help to protect each other and reduce the spread of the disease, particularly if you have coronavirus like symptoms. But this does not mean – and I must stress this – this does not mean wearing medical face masks, 2R or FFP3, which must be reserved for people who need them. We have all lived so far with onerous restrictions Mr Speaker on outdoor spaces and exercise, and this is where my honourable friend interjects as I know he’s a keen swimmer and unfortunately we can’t do anything for swimming pools but we can do something for lakes and the sea. and this is where we can go significantly further because there is a lower risk from outdoors than indoors. So from Wednesday there will be no limits on the frequency of outdoor exercise people can take. You can now walk, sit and rest in parks, you can play sports and exercise, and you can do all these things with members of your own household, or with one other person from another household, provided you observe social distancing and remain 2 metres apart from them. And I do hope that’s clear Mr Speaker. I’m conscious people want to come back and ask questions in more detail and I’d be very happy to answer. We shall increase the fines for the small minority who break the rules, starting at £100 but doubling with each infringement up to £3,600. You can drive as far as you like to reach an outdoor space, subject to the same rules and the laws and guidance of the Devolved Administrations. I am sorry to say however, Mr Speaker, that we shall continue to ask those who are clinically vulnerable – including pregnant women and people over 70, or those with pre-existing chronic conditions – to take particular care to minimise contact with those outside their households. And we must continue to shield people who are extremely vulnerable. They should, I am afraid, remain at home and avoid any direct contact with others. I know that easing restrictions for the many will only increase the anguish of those who must remain shielded, so the Government will look at every possible way of supporting the most vulnerable. Mr Speaker, all of our precautions will count for little if our country is re-infected from overseas, so I give notice that we shall introduce new restrictions at the UK border, requiring 14 days of self-isolation for international arrivals, while respecting our common travel area with Ireland. Every day, we shall monitor our progress, and if we stay on the downward slope, and the R remains below 1, then – and only then – will it become safe to go further, and move to the second step. This will not happen until 1st June at the earliest, but we may then be in a position to start the phased reopening of shops; to return children to early years’ settings, including nurseries and childminders; to return primary schools in stages, giving priority to the youngest children in reception and year 1, and those in year 6 preparing for secondary school; and to enable secondary school pupils facing exams next year to get at least some time with their teachers. Our ambition – and I stress this is conditional Mr Speaker –is for all primary school pupils to return to the classroom for a month before the summer break. To those ends, we are publishing guidance on how schools might reopen safely. Step two could also include allowing cultural and sporting events behind closed doors for broadcast, which I think would provide a much needed boost to national morale. But nothing can substitute for human contact and so the Government has asked SAGE when and how we could safely allow people to expand their household group to include one other household, on a strictly reciprocal basis. Finally, and no earlier than July, we may be able to move to step three – if and only if supported by the data, and the best scientific advice. We would then aim to reopen some remaining businesses, including potentially hospitality, cinemas and hairdressers as well as places of worship and leisure facilities. And this will depend on maintaining social distancing and new ways of providing services, so we will phase and pilot any re-openings to ensure public safety. And I must be clear again: if the data goes the wrong way, if the Alert Level begins to rise, we will have no hesitation in putting on the brakes, delaying or reintroducing measures – locally, regionally or nationally. Mr Speaker, our struggle against this virus has placed our country under the kind of strain that will be remembered for generations. But so too has the response of the British people, from dedicated shopworkers keeping our supermarkets open, and ingenious teachers finding new ways of inspiring their pupils, to the kindness of millions who have checked on their neighbours, delivered food for the elderly, or raised astonishing amounts for charity. In these and in so many other ways, we are seeing the indomitable spirit of Britain And Mr speaker let me summarise by saying that people should Stay Alert by working from home if you possibly can, by limiting contact with other people, by keeping your distance 2 metres apart where possible - by washing your hands regularly, and if you or anyone in your household has symptoms, you all need to self-isolate. Because if everyone stays alert and follows the rules, we can control the virus, keep the rate of infection down and the keep number of infections down. And this Mr Speaker is how we can continue to save lives, and livelihoods, as we begin to recover from coronavirus, and I commend this statement to the House."
"Boris Johnson","Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 24 May 2020","24 May 2020","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-press-conference-statement-24-may-2020","Coronavirus press conference 24 May 2020 Good afternoon. I want to begin by answering the big question that people have been asking in the last 48 hours. And that is – is this Government asking you - the people, the public, to do one thing while senior people here in government do something else? Have we been asking you to make sacrifices, to obey social distancing, to stay at home while some people have been basically flouting those rules and endangering lives? And it is because I take this matter so seriously and frankly it is so serious that I can tell you today I have had extensive face to face conversations with Dominic Cummings and I have concluded that in travelling to find the right kind of childcare, at the moment when both he and his wife were about to be incapacitated by coronavirus. And when he had no alternative, I think he followed the instincts of every father and every parent. And I do not mark him down for that. And though there have been many other allegations about what happened when he was in self-isolation and thereafter, some of them palpably false. I believe that in every respect he has acted responsibly, and legally, and with integrity, and with the overwhelming aim of stopping the spread of the virus and saving lives. And I stress this fundamental aim, because it is thanks to this country’s collective resolve in achieving that aim that we continue to make progress. So let me give you today’s figures: 3,458,905 tests for coronavirus have now been carried out in the UK, including 110,401 tests carried out yesterday 259,559 people have tested positive, that’s an increase of 2,409 cases since yesterday – a smaller increase than we were seeing over the last few weeks 8,951 people are in hospital with COVID-19 in the UK, down 11% from 10,085 this time last week And sadly, of those tested positive for coronavirus, across all settings, 36,793 have now died. That’s an increase of 118 fatalities since yesterday. And each of those fatalities represents a family in mourning, the grief of friends and relatives. And as we mourn them we resolve again to beat this virus and get our country back on its feet. We can and we will. Two weeks ago I set out the Government’s roadmap to begin easing the measures we put in place to control the spread of coronavirus. I said that we would do so in a safe and controlled way, based on our assessment of progress against the five tests we set for adjusting the lockdown. We’re going to set out that assessment in detail in the coming days, but today I can confirm that I do believe we will be in a position to move to step 2 of our plan. As part of Step 2, we set out plans for a phased reopening of schools. Because the education of our children is crucial for their welfare, their health, for their long term future and for social justice And so in line with the approach being taken by other countries, we want to start getting our children back in the classroom in a way that is manageable and as safe as possible. So we said this would begin with early years settings and reception, Year 1 and Year 6 in primary schools. Today I can announce that it is our intention to go ahead with that as planned on June 1st, a week on Monday. We then intend, from June 15th, for secondary schools to provide some contact for Year 10 and Year 12 students to help them prepare for exams next year, with up to a quarter of these students in at any point. By opening schools to more pupils in this limited way, we are taking a deliberately cautious approach. And this comes after a constructive period of consultation with schools, teachers and unions, led by the Education Secretary Gavin Williamson. I want to thank all the Education and childcare staff who have stepped up to the challenge and kept schools open throughout this crisis. The Department for Education will engage with teaching unions, local authorities and school leaders in the coming days, giving them an opportunity to ask questions and probe the evidence behind our plans. And the final decision will be taken as part of the formal review into lockdown measures which the law requires us to undertake by Thursday. We will of course continue to consider all the evidence (as we said we would do), and will continue to work hard with those bodies over the course of the coming week. However, I think it is important for us to be clear about the Government’s intentions now, so that teachers and parents can plan in earnest for schools to reopen a week on Monday. Now I acknowledge that a 1 June opening may not be possible for all schools, but the Government will continue to support and work with the sector to ensure that any schools experiencing difficulties are able to open more widely as soon as possible. Detailed guidance has been published by the Department for Education on how schools can open in a way which is safe for children, teachers and parents. While of course we recognise that full social distancing may not be possible, especially when teaching young children, our guidance sets out a range of protective measures to keep children and staff safe. This includes: reducing the size of classes and keeping children in small groups without mixing with others staggered break and lunch times, as well as drop offs and pick ups increasing the frequency of cleaning, reducing the used of shared items and utilising outdoor space All children and staff, and their families, will have access to testing if they display symptoms. This will enable children and staff to get back to school if they test negative, and if they test positive we will take the appropriate reactive measures. We will continue to work with the sector to support them to prepare for wider opening and ensure all children and young people can continue to receive the best care, education and training possible. We will set out what moving to step 2 means for other areas, such as non-essential retail and more social contacts, over the course of the next week. And let me stress once again: we are making good progress. But that progress is conditional, provisional. We must keep reducing the incidence of this disease. We must keep that R down below 1. And that means we must remember the basics. Wash our hands, keep social distance, isolate if you have symptoms – and get a test. We are beating this thing, but we will beat it all the faster if we stay alert, control the virus and save lives."
"Boris Johnson","Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 25 May 2020","25 May 2020","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-press-conference-statement-25-may-2020","Coronavirus press conference 25 May 2020 Good evening and welcome to the Number Ten Coronavirus Press Conference Before I turn to this evening’s announcements, I want to update you on the latest data 3,532,634 tests for coronavirus have now been carried out in the UK, including 73,726 tests carried out yesterday; 261,184 people have tested positive, that’s an increase of 1,625 cases since yesterday; 8,834 people are in hospital with COVID-19 in the UK, down (12%) from 10,092 this time last week; And sadly, of those who tested positive for coronavirus, across all settings, 36,914 have now died. That’s an increase of 121 fatalities since yesterday. This new figure includes deaths in all settings not just in hospitals. And once again my deepest condolences go out to all those who have lost their loved ones before their time. We must not, and will not, forget them. Two weeks ago, I set out our road map for the next phase of our fight against Covid 19 It is a cautious plan, informed by the evidence about what is safe, and conditional upon our continued progress against the virus. And we are making progress. Thanks to this country’s collective efforts, the key indicators are heading in the right direction. The daily number of deaths is down, the number of new cases is down, our survey evidence suggests the infection rate is falling, and the R has not risen above one. So just over 2 weeks ago, we moved to step 1 of our plan, encouraging those who are unable to work from home to go back to work, with new guidelines setting out how workplaces can be made COVID-secure. At the same time, we allowed people to spend more time outdoors and to meet one member of another household outside, provided they remain 2 metres apart. I also said we would be able to move to step 2 of our plan no earlier than Monday 1 June - a week today. We will set out our formal assessment of the 5 tests that we set for adjusting the lockdown later this week, as part of the 3 weekly-review we are legally required to undertake by Thursday. But because of the progress we are making, I can, with confidence, put the British people on notice of the changes we intend to introduce as we move into step 2. And I think it is important to give that notice, so that people have sufficient time to adjust and get ready before those changes come into effect. Yesterday I set out our intention to begin reopening nurseries and particular years in primary schools, reception, year 1, year 6, from 1 June, followed by some contact for those secondary school pupils with exams next year from 15 June. Some contact for years 10 and 12 from 15 June with their teachers. This announcement has given schools, teachers and parents clarity about our intentions, enabling them to prepare in earnest. The Department for Education is now engaging with teaching unions, councils and school leaders to help schools get ready. Today, I want to give the retail sector notice of our intentions to reopen shops, so they too can get ready. So I can announce that it is our intention to allow outdoor markets to reopen from June 1, subject to all premises being made COVID-secure, as well as car showrooms, which often have significant outdoor space and where it is generally easier to apply social distancing. We know that the transmission of the virus is lower outdoors and that it is easier to follow Covid Secure guidelines in open spaces. That means we can also allow outdoor markets to reopen in a safe way that does not risk causing a second wave of the virus. Then, from 15 June, we intend to allow all other non-essential retail, ranging from department stores to small, independent shops, to reopen. Again, this change will be contingent upon progress against the 5 tests and will only be permitted for those retail premises which are COVID-secure. Today we are publishing new guidance for the retail sector detailing the measures they should take to meet the necessary social distancing and hygiene standards. Shops now have the time to implement this guidance before they reopen. This will ensure there can be no doubt about what steps they should take. While the vast majority of businesses will want to do everything possible to protect their staff and customers, I should add that we will, of course, have the powers we need to enforce compliance where that is required. I want people to be confident they can shop safely, provided they follow the social distancing rules for all premises. The food retail sector has already responded fantastically well, enabling supermarkets to be kept open in a safe way – and we will learn lessons from that experience as we allow other retail to open. These are careful but deliberate steps on the road to rebuilding our country. And we can only take these steps thanks to what we have so far achieved together. We will only be successful if we all remember the basics - so wash your hands, keep social distance, and isolate if you have symptoms – and get a test. I will now hand over to Yvonne Doyle, Medical Director of Public Health England, to take us through today’s slides."
"Boris Johnson","Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 28 May 2020","28 May 2020","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-press-conference-statement-on-the-five-tests-28-may-2020","This transcript is for the coronavirus statement delivered on 28 May 2020: Coronavirus press conference 28 May 2020. Good evening, Before I set out our next steps in the fight against the coronavirus, let me update you on the latest data: 3,918,079 tests for coronavirus have now been carried out in the UK, including 119,587 tests carried out yesterday; 269,127 people have tested positive, that’s an increase of 1,887 cases since yesterday; 8,560 people are in hospital with coronavirus, down 11% from 9,607 this time last week. And sadly, of those tested positive for coronavirus, across all settings, 37,837 have now died. That’s an increase of 377 fatalities since yesterday and we are with their friends and family in mourning. As you know, we have set five tests which must be met before adjusting the lockdown - as set out on the first slide. It is vital that these tests are met before any changes are made, because we must not risk all the hard work and sacrifice of the British people. At all times we are informed by the data and evidence, about the spread of the virus and the impact of the measures taken so far. I will now take you through our latest assessment of progress against each of the five tests. Next slide please. Our first test is to protect the NHS’s ability to cope, so that we are confident that we are able to provide sufficient critical care and specialist treatment right across the UK. At the start of the outbreak, there was significant concern that the NHS would not be able to cope. That turned out not to be the case, thanks to the heroic efforts of everyone who works in the NHS. And the heroic efforts of the British people to contain this virus. The data show that on 26 May, 475 people were admitted to hospital in England with coronavirus - down from a peak of 3,121 on a single day, on 2 April. On 27 May, 11% of mechanical ventilator beds in the UK were occupied by patients with coronavirus, down from a peak of 41% on 10 April. This significant progress means we are meeting the first test. Can I have the next slide please. Our second test is to see a sustained and consistent fall in the daily death rates from COVID-19 so we are confident that we have moved beyond the peak. As measured by a seven-day rolling average, the UK daily death rate now stands at 256, down from a peak of 943 on 14 April. While every death is one too many, it is now the case that there has been a sustained and consistent fall in the daily death rate, and so the second test is being met. Next slide please. Our third test is to receive reliable information, reliable data from SAGE showing that the rate of infection - the number of people catching Covid - is decreasing to manageable levels across the board. And in the last seven days, an average of 2,312 new cases were confirmed with a positive test, that’s down from a peak of 5,066 in the first week of May. Based on the various data available, the Government is satisfied that the third test is being met. And in a moment, Sir Patrick will tell us more about other methods of measuring infections, including the R number. Next slide please. Our fourth test is that we must be confident that the range of operational challenges, including on testing capacity and Personal Protective Equipment, are in hand, with supply able to meet future demand. I fully acknowledge the difficulties on testing and PPE that we have faced since the start of the outbreak. It has been immensely frustrating, but we are now making progress. Yesterday we carried out 119,587 tests, compared to around 12,000 at the start of April. Testing capacity has now increased to 161,214 a day. We have now signed over 100 new deals with PPE suppliers around the world. Here in the UK, thanks to the efforts of Lord Deighton and his team and the brilliance of domestic manufacturers we have signed contracts for over two billion items of PPE, including facemasks, visors, gowns and aprons. We are therefore satisfied that the fourth test is being met and we can start to rebuild stocks - though we recognise there may be some settings that require urgent restocking on occasion. Can I have the next slide please. Our fifth and final test is that we must be confident that any adjustments to the current measures will not risk a second peak of infections that overwhelms the NHS. I am very grateful to the Chief Scientific Adviser and the Chief Medical Officer for their assessments of the measures I am about to set out on schools, retail and social contact. Although all parts of the UK are moving in the same direction, it is important to note health is devolved and different parts of the UK are quite properly all moving at different speeds. This package has been carefully designed so that we can ease the burdens of lockdown while expecting to keep that R below one. I cannot and will not throw away all the gains we have made together, and so the changes we are making are limited and cautious. It is thanks to the caution we have shown so far that all five tests are being met. That is not my achievement or the government’s achievement - it is your achievement, only possible thanks to your resolve and dedication to our national purpose to overcome this virus. So the result is we can move forward with adjusting the lockdown in England on Monday. Firstly, as I set out on Sunday, we will now reopen schools to more children. Closing schools has deprived children of their education, and as so often it is the most disadvantaged pupils who risk being hardest hit. On Monday we will start to put this right - in a safe way - by reopening nurseries and other early years settings and reception, year one and year six in primary schools. A fortnight later on 15 June, secondary schools will begin to provide some face-to-face contact time for years 10 and 12. Secondly, we will also start to reopen shops as we restart our economy. We will begin, on Monday, with outdoor retail and car showrooms, where social distancing is generally easier. And a fortnight later on 15 June, we intend to reopen other non-essential retail - but only provided the five tests are still being met and shops have been made Covid secure. Lastly, I know the toll that lockdown has taken on families and friends who have been unable to see each other. So from Monday we will allow up to six people to meet outside - provided those from different households continue strictly to observe social distancing rules by staying two metres apart. At the moment, as you know, people can meet in parks but not in private gardens. This was a cautious first step - but we know that there is no difference in the health risk. So we will now allow people to meet in gardens and other private outdoor spaces. These changes mean friends and family can start to meet their loved ones - perhaps seeing both parents at once, or both grandparents at once. I know that for many this will be a long-awaited and joyful moment. But I must stress that to control the virus, everyone needs to stay alert, act responsibly, strictly observe social distancing rules, and stay two metres apart from those who you do not live with. Minimising contact with others is still the best way to prevent transmission. You should also try to avoid seeing people from too many households in quick succession - so that we can avoid the risk of quick transmission from lots of different families and continue to control the virus. And it remains the case that people should not be inside the homes of their friends and families, unless it is to access the garden. I should add that, at this stage, I am afraid that those who have been asked to shield themselves should continue to do so. I want to say to those extremely clinically vulnerable people who are being shielded that I do understand how difficult this has been for you, especially. And I want to thank you for all the efforts you have gone to - because your actions have helped the NHS to cope. We are looking carefully at how we can make your life easier, and how we can better support you, and we want to say more on that soon. I want to reassure everyone that we can make all of the changes I have outlined in a safe way. We know that children, and particularly young children, are much less likely to be seriously affected by the virus. We know that if shops enforce social distancing, as required by our Covid secure guidelines, then the virus is less likely to spread. And crucially, we know that transmission of the virus is far lower outdoors, so we can confidently allow more interaction outside. I understand people will have questions as to how to do all of this safely - and we will publish guidance on these changes to help people, to help you, make the most of them. Now inevitably, there may still be some anomalies, or apparent inconsistencies, in these rules. And clearly what we’re proposing is still just a fraction of the social interaction each of us would normally enjoy. I know many of you will find this frustrating - I am sorry about that. But I’m afraid it is unavoidable, given the nature of the invisible enemy we are fighting. It is a complex problem and we are asking for everyone’s patience as we work through it together. We will inevitably not get everything right first time. But I must ask everyone to remember it is that same patience, the hard work, and sacrifices of the British people in lockdown that have got us so far and allow us to make the progress we have. By protecting the NHS, getting us through the peak, and getting the virus under control - we are able to deliver all of the adjustments and easing of restrictions I have set out today. These adjustments are most of those we set out to achieve in step two of our roadmap, and we have also been able to have them in place by June 1 as we had hoped. There is no doubt that we are making progress and I am hopeful that in the coming weeks we may be able to do more. Because obviously while protecting the health and safety of the British public is, and must always be, our number one priority, we must also work to restart our economy and society - so as many people as possible can begin returning to their way of life. But I want to reaffirm that fundamental commitment to the British people that all the steps we have taken, and will take, are conditional. They are conditional on all the data, and all the scientific advice, and it is that scientific advice which will help us to judge what we are doing is safe. And I have to warn you, there will be further local outbreaks. So we will monitor carefully, we will put on the brakes as required, and where necessary, we will re-impose measures. It’s important to be clear about that up front. And as before, we will see how these new changes are working, and look at the R value and the number of new infections before taking any further steps, so we can ensure anything we do does not risk a second peak that could overwhelm the NHS. And yesterday, as I hope you all know, we took a huge step forward that will enable us to keep making progress in returning our lives to as close to normal as possible, while continuing to control the virus and isolate any new outbreaks. And that is through our new NHS Test and Trace programme in England. The Scottish Government has established Test and Protect, and Welsh and Northern Irish schemes will follow next week. And I’ll now show a short video that explains how NHS Test and Trace works in England and what we all need to do to play our part. Now I’ll hand over to Sir Patrick."
"Boris Johnson","UK Science and Innovation Network Singapore on fighting COVID-19 with science","2 June 2020","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/uk-science-and-the-fight-against-covid-19","The UK’s world-class science, research and innovation institutions are working around the clock to understand and tackle the COVID-19 pandemic – both domestically and around the world. It is doing this by supporting vaccine trials in British labs and by collaborating with international partners to ensure a COVID-19-free world for all. Leading a united global push On the 4th of June, the UK will host the Gavi Global Vaccine Summit 2020. The event aims to unite countries in committing to global health security and ensuring that communities around the world have equitable access to vaccines. Earlier UK aid for Gavi is already underway in vaccinating 76 million children, saving 1.4 million lives from vaccine-preventable diseases by 2020 and we have now pledged an additional £330 million a year for the next five years. This makes us the single largest donor to the Alliance that has already helped vaccinate over 700 million children globally. This is but the latest initiative in a series of UK’s science-led international collaborations, embodying what PM Johnson has referred to as ‘humanity against the virus’. In April, the government launched the UK Vaccine Taskforce and pledged £250 million towards international efforts to develop a vaccine. A further £14 million was committed to 21 new research projects to rapidly progress treatments and vaccines. In addition, the UK co-hosted the International Coronavirus Global Response pledging event on 4 May that raised £6.billion for R&D towards COVID-19 vaccines, testing and treatment. More recently, the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) launched the Hygiene Hub – a new and free online platform backed by £500k of UK aid that will support governments in developing countries in strengthening their health and education systems to prevent future pandemics. UK-Singapore collaborations in COVID-19 treatment The LSHTM is also collaborating with the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health at the National University of Singapore on COVID-19 modelling studies. This is one in a number of UK-Singapore joint research on possible COVID-19 treatments that build on the strong alliances between our universities and labs. Another great collaboration was between researchers in the Nanyang Technological University Singapore and the University of Oxford who published a report on primary care handling of COVID-19 that fed into NICE telemedicine guidelines for medical practitioners around the world. Extending beyond Singapore, the UK’s Wellcome Trust is supporting a serological survey of COVID-19 infection risk in Singapore, Hong Kong and Thailand. The UK stands with the world, fighting COVID-19 together Delivering key collaborations across the region The UK’s Global Challenges Research Fund (GCRF) and Newton Fund Agile COVID-19 Response call funds COVID-19 research projects in Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Philippines, Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. In addition, several Newton Fund calls in Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand have been re-focused to address pandemic impacts on local communities, such as the Newton funded project CONI (COVID-19 Network Investigation Alliance) in Thailand, which uses genomic technology to investigate and monitor COVID-19 infections in the country. The UK has also recently launched the Global Effort on COVID-19 (GECO) Health Research call that focuses on delivering priority areas in the WHO COVID-19 Roadmap and is especially targeting low and middle income countries, including in the Southeast Asian region. Funding COVID R&D in the UK Back in the UK, the UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) has been at the forefront of supporting domestic R&D in COVID-19 treatment, diagnostic and vaccines. It has made available £25 million through the UKRI/NIHR rapid response call for COVID-19 research, and an additional £42.5 million to support clinical testing of vaccines at the University of Oxford and Imperial College London. With government funding, the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca are collaborating on a potential recombinant adenovirus vaccine aimed at preventing COVID-19 infection from SARS-CoV-2. Human trials of this have now begun. Simultaneously, government support has enabled clinical trials of 40,000 healthcare workers as the University races to study the effectiveness of anti-malaria treatment on the COVID-19 virus. A recent £93 million boost in funding will accelerate the establishment of a specialist Vaccines Manufacturing and Innovation Centre (under construction in Oxfordshire, south central England) in mid-2021, a year ahead of schedule. Putting science at the heart of recovery The cure for COVID-19 is yet a way off but the achievements of our researchers, back home in the UK and those in labs around the world, give us reason to stay fiercely optimistic. With government support led by science and innovative businesses and academia working hand-in-hand, the UK is fully committed to ensure that not only will we find a solution together, but that when we do, it will be accessible to anyone who needs it, no matter where they are.

"Boris Johnson","PM Boris Johnson article on Hong Kong: 3 June 2020","3 June 2020","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-boris-johnson-article-on-hong-kong-3-june-2020","There is something wonderful about the fact that a small island in the Pearl River Delta rose to become a great trading city and commercial powerhouse of East Asia. Wonderful, but not accidental or fortuitous. Hong Kong succeeds because its people are free. They can pursue their dreams and scale as many heights as their talents allow. They can debate and share new ideas, expressing themselves as they wish. And they live under the rule of law, administered by independent courts. With their abilities thus released, Hong Kong’s people have shown that they can achieve almost anything. They have prospered hand in hand with China’s economic renaissance; today their home is one of the richest cities in the world and hundreds of mainland companies have chosen to list on the Hong Kong stock exchange. So China has a greater interest than anyone else in preserving Hong Kong’s success. Since the handover in 1997, the key has been the precious concept of “one country, two systems”, enshrined in Hong Kong’s Basic Law and underpinned by the joint declaration signed by Britain and China. This guarantees Hong Kong’s “high degree of autonomy” with only limited exceptions such as foreign affairs, defence or in a state of emergency. The declaration adds: “The current social and economic systems in Hong Kong will remain unchanged, and so will the lifestyle”, including essential “rights and freedoms”. Yet last month, the National People’s Congress in Beijing decided to impose a national security law on Hong Kong that would curtail its freedoms and dramatically erode its autonomy. If China proceeds, this would be in direct conflict with its obligations under the joint declaration, a legally binding treaty registered with the United Nations. Britain would then have no choice but to uphold our profound ties of history and friendship with the people of Hong Kong. Today, about 350,000 of the territory’s people hold British National (Overseas) passports and another 2.5 million would be eligible to apply for them. At present, these passports allow visa-free access to the United Kingdom for up to six months. If China imposes its national security law, the British government will change our immigration rules and allow any holder of these passports from Hong Kong to come to the UK for a renewable period of 12 months and be given further immigration rights, including the right to work, which could place them on a route to citizenship. This would amount to one of the biggest changes in our visa system in history. If it proves necessary, the British government will take this step and take it willingly. Many people in Hong Kong fear that their way of life — which China pledged to uphold — is under threat. If China proceeds to justify their fears, then Britain could not in good conscience shrug our shoulders and walk away; instead we will honour our obligations and provide an alternative. I hope it will not come to this. I still hope that China will remember that responsibilities go hand in glove with strength and leadership. As China plays a greater role on the international stage — commensurate with its economic prowess — then its authority will rest not simply on its global weight but on its reputation for fair dealing and magnanimity. Britain does not seek to prevent China’s rise; on the contrary we will work side by side on all the issues where our interests converge, from trade to climate change. We want a modern and mature relationship, based on mutual respect and recognising China’s place in the world. And it is precisely because we welcome China as a leading member of the world community that we expect it to abide by international agreements. I also struggle to understand how the latest measure might ease tensions in Hong Kong. For much of last year, the territory experienced large protests, triggered by an ill-judged attempt to pass a law allowing extradition from Hong Kong to the mainland. If China now goes further and imposes national security legislation, this would only risk inflaming the situation. For our part, the UK raised our grave concerns about Hong Kong in the UN security council last week; we will continue to do so in international fora. Instead of making false allegations — such as claiming that the UK somehow organised the protests — or casting doubt over the joint declaration, I hope that China will work alongside the international community to preserve everything that has allowed Hong Kong to thrive. Britain wants nothing more than for Hong Kong to succeed under “one country, two systems”. I hope that China wants the same. Let us work together to make it so."

And sadly, of those tested positive for coronavirus, across all settings, 39,728 have now died. That’s an increase of 359 fatalities since yesterday and once again we are with their families in mourning. Now that the rate of transmission in the UK has significantly fallen from its peak, we need to take steps to manage the flare-ups and stop the virus re-emerging in the UK. I want to update you on the progress we are making on three fronts to prevent a second wave of infections that could overwhelm the NHS. First, we have set up NHS Test and Trace in order to identify, contain and control the virus in the UK, thereby reducing its spread. As we move to the next stage of our fight against coronavirus, we will be able to replace national lockdowns with individual isolation and, if necessary, local action where there are outbreaks. NHS Test and Trace will be vital to controlling the spread of the virus. It’s how we will be able to protect our friends and family from infection, and protect our NHS. It does this by identifying anyone who has been in close contact with someone who has tested positive, and asking them to isolate for 14 days in order to avoid unknowingly infecting others. The system clearly relies on everyone playing their part. So I want to stress again today: we need you to get a test if you have coronavirus symptoms – a high temperature, a new, continuous cough, or a loss of taste or smell. There is plenty of capacity and everyone with symptoms is eligible, everyone with symptoms, so please order a test from nhs.uk/coronavirus as soon as you develop symptoms. And we need you to isolate yourself if a contact tracer tells you that you have been in contact with someone who has tested positive. NHS Test and Trace started operating a week ago. And already thousands of people are isolating who wouldn’t have been doing so before this service was introduced. They are thereby protecting others and reducing the spread of the virus. So while we are going to all these efforts here in the UK to control the virus, we must also ensure we don’t reimport the virus from abroad. So the second action I want to update you on is the introduction of public health measures at the border. Today the Home Secretary has brought forward the legislation needed to establish the new regime from Monday. And I want to explain the reasons for introducing these measures now. When coronavirus started to spread around the world, first from Wuhan and then from northern Italy and other areas, we introduced enhanced monitoring at the border in an attempt to stop the virus from gaining a foothold in the UK. These measures applied, at various different times, to arrivals from China, Japan, Iran and Italy, and required people with symptoms travelling from those countries to self-isolate for 14 days. However, once community transmission was widespread within the UK, cases from abroad made up a tiny proportion of the total. At the same time you’ll remember that international travel plummeted as countries around the world went into lockdown. So as a result, measures at the border were halted because they made little difference at the time in our fight against the virus. Now that we’re getting the virus under control in the UK, there’s a risk cases from abroad begin once again to make up a greater proportion of overall cases. We therefore need to take steps now to manage that risk of these imported cases triggering a second peak. So just as we are asking people already in the UK to isolate for 14 days when contacted by NHS Test and Trace, we’re also asking those arriving from abroad to isolate so that they don’t unknowingly spread the virus. There will be some exemptions for a limited number of people who need to cross the border, such as those engaged directly in the fight against coronavirus or who provide essential services. And we will review how the policy is working after three weeks. And of course we will explore the possibility of international travel corridors with countries that have low rates of infection - but only when the evidence shows that it is safe to do so. The third point I want to make today is we need effective international action to reduce the impact of the virus across the globe. This is the moment really for humanity to unite in the fight against the disease. Health experts have warned that if coronavirus is left to spread in developing countries, that could lead to future waves of infection coming back and reaching the UK. While our amazing NHS has been there for everyone in this country who needs it, many developing countries have healthcare systems which are ill-prepared to manage this pandemic. So to ensure that the world’s poorest countries have the support they need to slow the spread of the virus, tomorrow I will open the Global Vaccine Summit. Hosted by the UK, and will bring together more than 50 countries and leading figures like Bill Gates to raise at least $7.4 billion for Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. Over the next five years – with the UK’s support as Gavi’s biggest donor – this Vaccine Alliance aims to immunise a further 300 million children in the poorest countries against deadly diseases like polio, typhoid and measles – again saving millions of lives. This support for routine immunisations will shore up poorer countries’ healthcare systems to deal with coronavirus – and so help to stop the global spread and, as I say, prevent a second wave of the virus reaching the UK. This virus has shown how connected we are. We’re fighting an invisible enemy. And no one is safe frankly until we are all safe. And again, of course this is all contingent upon each of us continuing to do our bit. And as I never tire of telling you Let us not forget the basics. Wash your hands regularly and for 20 seconds, wash your hands. Do not gather in groups of more than six outside. Always observe social distancing, keeping 2 metres apart from anyone outside your household. And I want to stress one final point which may be relevant today as the weather threatens I think to take a turn for the worse. Some of you may be tempted to move the gatherings you’ve been enjoying outdoors, indoors, out of the rain. I really urge you – don’t do that. We relaxed the rules on meeting outside for a very specific reason – because the evidence shows that the risks of transmission are much lower outdoors, much lower outdoors. And the risks of passing on the virus are significantly higher indoors, which is why gatherings inside other people’s homes are still prohibited. Breaking these rules now could undermine and reverse all the progress that we’ve made together. I have no doubt that that won’t happen, I’ve no doubt that that won’t happen. I think the British public will continue to show the same resolve in fighting the virus as they have throughout the outbreak. We will get through this if we stay alert, control the virus, and in doing so save lives."
"Boris Johnson","PM Global Vaccine Summit closing remarks: 4 June 2020","4 June 2020","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-global-vaccine-summit-closing-remarks-4-june-2020","As we bring this summit to a conclusion, let me thank you all for the generosity of your contributions today. Together, we have replenished this alliance, securing – and I’m the lucky one that gets to make the big announcement – a fantastic $8.8bn for Gavi’s vital work over the next five years. And I want to say a particular thank you to Bill and Melinda Gates for their generosity, their philanthropy, yet again, and their continued leadership in humanity’s battle against disease. Our ancestors had to live with the unavoidable reality that killer pathogens could at any time strike down their children, imposing an incalculable burden of sorrow. Yet, today, thanks to the ingenuity of Edward Jenner, a British doctor from Gloucestershire who pioneered the world’s first vaccine, the simple act of inoculating our children can save lives many times over. Vaccines work. People who are vaccinated protect themselves and the rest of the population by lowering the spread and risk of infection. Gavi’s work on routine immunisation is the strongest shield against outbreaks of infectious diseases, and so it is that our collective efforts at this Summit will now save up to 8 million lives. Our actions – your actions - will also support healthcare systems in the world’s poorest countries, which are increasingly victims of coronavirus. So today, as we make the choice to unite and forge a path of global co-operation, let us also renew our collective resolve to find the vaccine that can in the end defeat coronavirus. For our part, the UK has already committed up to £764 million for the global coronavirus response. And I’m proud to say that some of the most promising research into vaccines is happening here, supported by our Vaccine Taskforce. We are pioneering the innovative collaborations that will be needed to manufacture and distribute a vaccine, once found, like the partnership between AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford. So as we conclude today, let us unite to stop a disease like coronavirus causing such devastation ever again. Just as we have great military alliances like NATO – and I hope that those of you not in NATO know what I mean - where countries collaborate on building their collective military defence, so we now need that same spirit of collaboration and collective defence against the common enemy of disease. It will require a new international effort to co-operate on the surveillance and sharing of information that can underpin a global alert system so we can rapidly identify any future outbreak. And it will need a radical scaling up of our global capacity to respond, exactly as Bill [Gates] has set out. So just as Britain has been honoured to host this summit today, you can count on our full contribution as together we rise to fulfil the greatest shared endeavour of our lifetimes: the triumph of humanity over disease, now and for the generations that follow. Thank you."
"Boris Johnson","Prime Minister message on Black Lives Matter","8 June 2020","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-minister-message-on-black-lives-matter","The death of George Floyd took place thousands of miles away – in another country, under another jurisdiction – and yet we simply cannot ignore the depth of emotion that has been triggered by that spectacle, of a black man losing his life at the hands of the police. In this country and around the world his dying words – I can’t breathe – have awakened an anger and a widespread and incontrovertible, undeniable feeling of injustice, a feeling that people from black and minority ethnic groups do face discrimination: in education, in employment, in the application of the criminal law. And we who lead and who govern simply can’t ignore those feelings because in too many cases, I am afraid, they will be founded on a cold reality. Yes, I am proud to lead the most ethnically diverse government in the history of this country, with two of the four great offices of state held by a man and a woman of Indian origin; and yes, I am proud of the work I began to lead more than ten years ago to recruit and promote more young black people, in the police and other walks of life. This country has made huge strides. I remember the 1970s, and the horror of the National Front. I truly believe that we are a much, much less racist society than we were, in many ways far happier and better. But we must also frankly acknowledge that there is so much more to do – in eradicating prejudice, and creating opportunity, and the government I lead is committed to that effort. And so I say yes, you are right, we are all right, to say Black Lives Matter; and to all those who have chosen to protest peacefully and who have insisted on social distancing – I say, yes of course I hear you, and I understand. But I must also say that we are in a time of national trial, when for months this whole country has come together to fight a deadly plague. After such sacrifice, we cannot now let it get out of control. It is BAME communities who have been at the forefront of the struggle against coronavirus – whether in health care or transport or social care or any of the other essential services that have kept our country going. And it is BAME communities, tragically, that have paid a disproportionate price. So no, I will not support those who flout the rules on social distancing, for the obvious reason that we risk a new infection at a critical time and just as we have made huge progress. And no, I will not support or indulge those who break the law, or attack the police, or desecrate public monuments. We have a democracy in this country. If you want to change the urban landscape, you can stand for election, or vote for someone who will. And so I must say clearly that those who attack public property or the police –who injure the police officers who are trying to keep us all safe – those people will face the full force of the law; not just because of the hurt and damage they are causing, but because of the damage they are doing to the cause they claim to represent. They are hijacking a peaceful protest and undermining it in the eyes of many who might otherwise be sympathetic. And as a society, we can and must do better. This month, on the 22nd of June, we celebrate the arrival of the Empire Windrush in 1948, and we remember the contribution of the Afro-Caribbean workers – in the NHS and across all public services – who helped to rebuild this country after the war. And today, once again, we face a great task: to relaunch this country after Coronavirus. So let’s work peacefully, lawfully, to defeat racism and discrimination wherever we find it, and let us continue to work together across all the communities of this country, as we put Britain back on its feet."
"Boris Johnson","Governor to Falkland Islands delivers annual address to Legislative Assembly","9 June 2020","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/governor-to-falkland-islands-delivers-annual-address-to-legislative-assembly","Mr Speaker, Honourable Members, Scene setting I am pleased to stand before you today to deliver the Governor’s Annual Address, which comes as the third Budget of the current Legislative Assembly is put before the House. In these unprecedented times, one cannot deliver such an address without taking note of the acute global uncertainty and upheaval resulting from the global COVID-19 pandemic. Throughout the crisis this Government has responded with the health and welfare of residents as its key priority. Going forward, the Government is determined not to allow the pandemic to stand in the way of the bold, ambitious social and economic development agenda of the Falkland Islands; nor will it allow it to obscure the significant progress already made in the term of the current legislative assembly. Indeed, the Budget being presented today is evidence of the resolve of this Government to overcome challenges that may present themselves, in the delivery of the Islands Plan and the pursuit of long-term progress, health and wellbeing, opportunity and prosperity for the people of the Falkland Islands. My address today is an opportunity to highlight the steady progress of these islands, the solid foundations on which their future is built, and the optimism that the Falklands has in terms of fostering social and economic progress in order to improve the quality of life for all residents. Fiscal context Mr. Speaker, as the Government charts its course towards our future the need for financial stability is ever more important. Through careful financial management, and despite the recent upheaval, the Government is again targeting an excess of income over expenditure this year. Corporation tax receipts from the fishing industry and other businesses, sale of fishing licences and income from investments, managed as part of the Consolidated Fund, continue to represent the primary contribution to government revenues. Other sectors such as tourism, agriculture and the retail and service sectors also made valuable contributions. Government finances remain in robust shape, fortified by strong reserves and a prudent fiscal approach to spending. It is these reserves which have provided the Government the flexibility to not only invest in a range of support measures to address the urgent needs of Falkland Island residents and businesses during the COVID-19 crisis, but also to enable further investment in our capital and service delivery programmes. This coming year - 2020/21 - will see an operating budget of £81.7 million and a transfer to the Capital Equalization Fund of £29.1 million in support of Capital investments. Mr. Speaker: the capacity of the Government to plan and execute capital projects is increasing. The projected capital expenditure for 2019/20 is £26 million compared to £23.3m in the previous year: an increase of 11.5%. At this point I would like to note the efforts of our former Financial Secretary, James Wilson for his prudent and considered approach to financial management that helped contribute to the strong financial position of the Falkland Islands. I would also like to acknowledge his work that resulted in providing local businesses access to international banking facilities – including card-based financial transactions – and to opening up the world of e-commerce. Political context Internationally, there have been many changes over the course of this year. There is now a newly elected Parliament in the United Kingdom, and closer to our shores new Governments in Argentina and Uruguay. Changes resulting from Brexit may also affect the way in which the Falkland Islands trade not only with Europe but also the world more broadly. However, something that has not changed is the support of the government of the United Kingdom for the Islands – including the defence of its sovereignty and the right to self-determination. As pointed out by Prime Minister Boris Johnson in his 2019 Christmas address, UK support for the rights of Falkland Islanders to determine their own political status is not going to change. This ongoing support has been significantly enhanced during the COVID-19 pandemic. The additional support provided by the UK Government has helped safeguard our community, and I know I speak for all when I acknowledge that contribution. With respect to Brexit, I can assure you that the Falkland Islands Government will continue to work closely with the UK Government to ensure that the interests of the Falkland Islands are fully understood in the United Kingdom. To that end this government will continue, whilst safeguarding our sovereignty, to develop productive and constructive relationships with South America and across the globe to benefit the community. An excellent example of international outreach was the Assembly’s hosting of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association Women’s Conference for the British Islands and Mediterranean Region. Delegates came from Cyprus, Gibraltar, Guernsey, Jersey, Malta, Scotland, St Helena, England and Wales. Invitations had also been accepted by senators from both Chile and Uruguay but business in their parliaments meant they could not attend. The conference theme was challenging stereotypes, and attendees heard in particular from female leaders from the Falkland Islands and their experiences. The Government has also been vigorously engaged in its overseas responsibilities - with MLAs attending the C24 Committee meeting at the UN, OAS, CPA events, engaging with UKOTA and OCTA, and of course, supporting engagement with the UK and others on Brexit. Constructive relationships between countries are not just about institutional engagement. They are fundamentally about relationships between people and with that in mind humanitarian work has continued with Argentina. Early in 2020 the Falkland Islands welcomed Mrs. Elmer Pelozo, the first person to agree to DNA sampling for the Argentine Cemetery Humanitarian project. Mrs. Pelozo visited her son’s grave for the first time in March, and I hope this provided a level of closure to Mrs. Pelozo and her family. The Humanitarian project started in 2017 and continues to highlight the community’s compassion and kindness across the world. The Islands Plan 2018-2022 – update on initiatives This last year has seen significant progress in many initiatives described in the Islands Plan. A very active Public Diplomacy programme season was completed. Delivered in partnership with FCO, there have now been 32 inbound Public Diplomacy missions since January 2018 with a total of 84 influencers visiting the Falkland Islands. Countries of origin included India, Canada, Brazil, Chile, Uruguay, Argentina, Peru, UK, and France. November saw the inauguration of the Sao Paulo to Falklands air route. This long-awaited second commercial air link was already starting to build in popularity before its temporary suspension due to the pandemic. Its value for the economy is wide ranging, will prove substantial, and we all look forward to its resumption at a later date. Richard Hyslop took up his new role as the Falkland Islands Government Representative to the UK and Europe in November, following the retirement of Sukey Cameron after 30 years of dedicated work as the Representative. In furtherance of this Government’s objective to raise the profile of the Falklands in the United Kingdom, Richard and the wider FIGO team, have been incredibly busy ensuring that the interests of the Falkland Islands Government and the Islands are heard in media, parliament, elsewhere in the United Kingdom and beyond. I have been especially pleased to see the focus in representing the wider Island interests. This includes highlighting tourism, promoting Falkland Island products, and helping to secure inward investment into the Islands. There is also work on a Falkland Islander diaspora network in the UK. I must note the 50th anniversary of the SS Great Britain’s return to Bristol from the Falkland Islands. Alongside the Falkland Islands Association, FIG have been working closely with the SS Great Britain Museum to create an outdoor photographic exhibition telling the modern Falkland Islands story – along with other supporting events. The Government has also continued to work toward strengthening our commercial and social relationships in South America and to that end the Government has extended the full-time Falkland Islands Adviser position for a further two years after a successful first year of activity. The position, which is based in Montevideo, improves our awareness of opportunity and access to markets in the region and strengthens our economic and social ties to the region. The Islands Plan 2018-2022 – update on capital investments This Budget remains committed to delivering a number of major capital projects, with £29.07 million in new funds allocated in 2020-21, as part of a capital programme valued at £120 million between 2019 and 2024. These investments include new housing developments, the Tussac House long-term care facility, and the King Edward Memorial Hospital expansion. A new port is set to be the largest single development in the five years up to 2024– moving on the commitment set out in the Islands Plan. After a rigorous procurement process, FIG announced in February 2020 its intention to contract BAM Nuttall Ltd to design and build the port. The contract was signed in April. This Budget includes provision for the design development work to begin in July, with extensive local engagement with port users and the wider community including partners such as the British Antarctic Survey and the International Association of Antarctic Tour Operators. Our Public Works Department continues to deliver our commitment to upgrade the arterial link to MPA. Another 4 miles of the MPA road has been completed, and next season should see an asphalt surface all the way to the south side of Fitzroy ridge. Works have continued on the Camp roads and an ambitious season is planned for next summer on both East and West Falklands. The next phase of housing infrastructure development will begin in June and will deliver in total over 100 additional serviced plots. The Government expects to develop around 40 plots, with the rest released to the public. The Falkland Islands Government housing project on Sapper Hill is also progressing at pace with 8 new houses and 14 more to follow. The next phase of 50 houses will be tendered soon after a slight delay. Private Sector housing provision has grown at pace in a sector that clearly needs extra capacity. The interim power station project has been delivered with three high-speed engines to support the existing system. Detailed design of the new power station is due to be completed by the end of this year. In realising this plan, the Government is reaping the benefits of work done to identify and tackle resource constraints, such as workforce and accommodation. Our planning is improved, and we have made significant investments as well in equipment and plant at the quarry. Aviation services have had another busy 12 months. Investment in the service continues, with the avionics and engine replacement programme near to completion and a new pilot joining the team after finishing her training. The first of two new aircraft is expected to be in the islands around September – ready for the new season with the second following in December. FIGAS unveiled in March the colours of the new plane, named Sir Miles Clifford, in honour of the Governor who was instrumental in its formation in 1948. The capital programme recognises the need to strengthen linkages within Camp. The Public Works Department has therefore, alongside the road programme already mentioned, embarked upon a five year programme of investment in upgrades to ramps and jetties at various locations across the whole of the Falkland Islands. The Government continues to work with Sure to support much needed improvements to the Camp network. A new VHF 2m Radio network is due to be completed by August and a comprehensive national radio infrastructure survey was carried out to inform future investment decisions. In addition to improving the quality of life for residents in Camp, such investments have the added benefit of improving the capacity and growth of tourism businesses outside Stanley. Agriculture Agriculture remains of key importance not only to the economy but also to society across the entire Falkland Islands. Agriculture is so important to the identity and the culture of the Falkland Islands. As such the Government will continue to support and help grow our agricultural industry. Last year I noted a buoyant market for our wool. But in the last two months we have seen how dramatically COVID-19 has collapsed global wool demand. I therefore commend the Government for acting decisively in implementing a Wool Producers Assistance Programme. This generous government sponsored wool purchase programme will provide revenue replacement for wool producers in the Falkland Islands at a time of great uncertainty in global wool markets. In so doing it will help preserve the ongoing viability of this important sector. In anticipation of the wool markets recovery, the Falklands will continue to work with partners to provide advice and support to farmers. In the last two years the Farm Improvement Programme has been reviewed, a Director of Wool Innovation has been hired and the Falkland Islands Development Corporation, the Agricultural Service and other stakeholders continue to work together to provide support for businesses in the light of challenging market conditions. Work has also been undertaken in relation to participation in international organisations and forums that promote awareness and trade of agricultural commodities, largely based around the newly established relationship with the International Wool Textile Association. Marine and fisheries Fisheries remains a backbone of our economy, and a particularly important step was the signing of an Accord between the Government and the Falkland Islands Fishing Companies Association. The Accord delivers on a commitment made in the Islands Plan for the Government to work in partnership with fishing companies for a responsibly managed fishery, underpinned by improving understanding of the ecosystem. The Government has also approved the opportunity of early renewal of ITQ quota, enabling longer term security for businesses. The industry enjoyed a successful squid season in early 2020 - total catches of Illex squid reached 62,000 tonnes, above the average in the last 4 years. 30,000 tonnes of Loligo were harvested as well and a second season is planned to open at the end of July. The government’s desire to protect the environment was evidenced by the fact that seabird and marine mammals’ bycatch were negligible, thanks to the hard work put into mitigation measures. Although the effects of COVID 19 on overall demand remain to be fully understood, prices for squid remain reasonably buoyant. Separately the Government will investigate whether aquaculture of salmon in inshore waters is feasible from an environmental, social, and economic perspective. It is understood that the current proposal presented to the Government is at a very early stage and that we need, over the next few years, to improve our understanding of the industry before potentially deciding on a commitment to proceed further. The Government has recently updated and modernised our key maritime legislation as it works towards the external International Maritime Organization audit that the UK and her associated Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies will undergo in September. This long-term commitment started in 2015. The designation of a Maritime Authority in 2018 was a key element and the Government is now working to strengthen it with implementation of our ordinances and ensuring their consistent enforcement. The Falklands successfully hosted and co-chaired the Red Ensign Group (REG) conference in February which further validated our commitment to all things maritime and raised our international profile as a maritime centre in the South Atlantic. The Government continues to work towards meeting our international obligations as a Flag, Coastal and Port State and in October this year it will finally commence with a locally-developed and staffed Port State Control regime to ensure safety of foreign-flagged merchant ships visiting our ports. Oil Mr Speaker, the last year has been a rather turbulent one in the oil industry. Since the beginning of 2020, the global economic downturn resulting from COVID-19 has led to the oil price declining sharply, and the Sea Lion project has been paused for the time being. However, considerable work has been done in the Department of Mineral Resources, and across government, that will ensure that the Falkland Islands is fully prepared for such development, when it makes economic sense for the project to proceed, from a legal, regulatory, fiscal and socio-economic perspective. This work has been supported by the relevant specialists within the UK Government, and a new approach to project management has been introduced to provide greater focus on the essential elements required to deliver a well informed decision. The technical and environmental work to inform the necessary applications for project consent is already substantially complete and a revised Environmental Impact Assessment was accepted by Executive Council following public consultation earlier in the year. As further evidence of its commitment to sound planning, the Government also completed a report on the Socio-Economic Impact of Oil and Gas Development which also involved looking at public infrastructure projects. This report that was considered by ExCo in October provided an encouraging assessment of the effects of growth resulting from private sector developments in the oil sector. In so doing the report considered a wide range of issues including not only oil development but also population growth, national infrastructure and the effects on the labour force in sectors such as agriculture, fisheries and tourism, potential social impacts, public revenues and both overall public and private sector employment. Economic development In terms of overall economic development, the Government has continued to work with businesses and key stakeholders such as the Falkland Islands Development Corporation, the Chamber of Commerce, the Falkland Island Tourist Board and the Falkland Islands Tourism Association, the Rural Business Association and the Falkland Islands Fishing Companies Association to better inform its policies and ongoing economic development policy initiatives. A significant initiative currently underway that will greatly assist in the economic development of the Islands is a project in relation to a Doppler LIDAR solution to help better manage the Mount Pleasant airfield during and around Rotor wind events. This project, being undertaken in conjunction with the Met Office, is the result of a significant financial commitment from this Government and this project will soon proceed to the next stage. Environment Blessed as we are to live in the Falkland Islands, the Government is conscious that there is much to be done to preserve and protect the environment we have. Both locally, and globally, people have increasingly high expectations that the Falkland Islands Government will proactively and effectively manage its unique and diverse ecosystems in a manner that protects our environment for future generations as well as allowing for sustainable human activity and economic development for the present generation. To further that, the Government has committed to establishing a new Environment Department with a new Head of Environment position to strengthen its ability to manage and conserve the natural environment in a sustainable and balanced manner for the benefit of all Islanders. In the meantime, work is continuing on the modernisation of environmental legislation such as the Conservation of Wildlife and Nature Ordinance (1999); the completion of the Falkland Island’s Biodiversity Framework; implementation of the Stanley Commons Management Plan; detailed policy work to help support further consideration of new Pollution Prevention Control legislation and regulations; and the completion and implementation of a comprehensive environmental strategy. I am pleased to note that these sorts of initiatives are starting to have a positive effect. For example, the 2018 Waste Management Strategy is now bearing fruit, with 2019’s successful glass recycling scheme now being followed by a can and tin collection programme. Further projects are in train, including a new landfill and waste transfer station, and a modern incinerator plant. The Government also continues to focus on invasive species and biosecurity to protect our agriculture industry and protect our biodiversity. In regard to pest control, a highly successful Calafate control programme has now treated over 500 hectares of land. Elsewhere, our Biosecurity service has inspected 156 flights and 24 boat arrivals and stopped high-risk materials entering our environment. The Government will also continue to represent the Falkland Islands internationally. The voice of the Falkland Islands was to have been heard on climate change at COP26, but this has now been rescheduled for November 2021 and representatives will be in attendance to highlight and promote the role of the Falkland Islands people as stewards of their environment. The Government will also continue to encourage and promote the Falkland Islands as a hub for environmental research in the South Atlantic. Research into the Falkland Islands environment is continuously being encouraged with the South Atlantic Environmental Research Institute providing a key link with various research organisations in over 20 different countries. Tourism and sports Mr Speaker, in talking of our tourism industry, there is no way of avoiding the very abrupt punctuation mark of COVID-19 that occurred near the end of what was a record breaking tourism season in the Falkland Islands with 72,836 cruise passengers arriving, up 16.5 per cent on the previous season. The expedition cruise market grew significantly, up 30 per cent to 16,931 arrivals. Tourists arriving by air also increased, numbering 1,648 between October and March, up 6.7 per cent. However as we are all aware, public health related containment measures adopted both locally and globally, as a result of the pandemic, resulted in near cessation of international travel and have had a consequent effect on both the global and the local tourism industry. Although the effects of the pandemic were felt near to the end of what had been an exceptionally good land-based and cruise tourism season in the Falklands, the effects will be most keenly felt next season. The Government will work with the tourism sector to help forecast and manage the potential short, medium and long term impacts of COVID-19. In furtherance of this objective, the Government will continue to combine a variety of resources including not only its ongoing funding support for high-level awareness marketing initiatives but also its strategic use of the Public Diplomacy Programme; the ongoing engagement activities of the Falkland Islands Advisor in Uruguay with the South American tourism industry; and the ability of the Falkland Islands Government Office in London to engage with tourism industry stakeholders in the United Kingdom. Travel is of course two-way, something we again saw enthusiastically embraced by our sports people. With considerable support from the Government, Islanders competed across the world – from China, New Zealand, Europe, to Brazil and the United States. They covered marathons, sheep shearing, badminton, ice hockey to table tennis, squash and even short mat bowls. The Islands also hosted the International Island Games Committee this year, with fantastic feedback. When international sporting events begin again the Falklands will continue to impress with our determination, skills, and sportsmanship. Health and wellbeing Mr. Speaker I would now like to turn to Health and Wellbeing with a focus initially on investments made in this budget and progress to date on some important initiatives. I will refer to COVID-19 specific issues later in my address. The guiding principle for the government remains the same - improving the health and wellbeing of our community and ensuring that people can enjoy the best possible quality of life, with our support where and when it is needed. The Budget continues to make health and wellbeing a priority, investing £25m for further service improvements in health and social services. Work has continued on the improvements to the hospital infrastructure - for example work on the Mammography Suite is due for completion by the end of June and further preparatory work for the installation of the CT scanner has also continued. Work on Mental Health services has proceeded, and the final draft of the Mental Health Strategy will be ready this month for consideration. Progress meanwhile has been made in relation to the Vulnerable Persons Unit, or Tussac House, with groundworks commencing in October 2019 and the project ready for the next stage. I referred last year to the establishment of a new Public Health Unit. Earlier this year it surveyed nearly 600 residents, resulting in a major and valuable snapshot of health and lifestyle in the Falklands. This is just the sort of baseline work that can guide us in making better decisions about how to support the health and wellbeing of our people, both in the short and long term. Education Mr Speaker, beyond the physical health and wellbeing of the nation, the future will be shaped by how we nurture our youngest generations. I am delighted to report a year of progress for our Education Department. I was able last year to note the strong educational outcomes for our secondary school, and the groundworks being laid for Falkland College. Falkland College and the Christie Community Library are now open: an impressive new building that widens access to academic programmes, both on and off island, and lifelong learning opportunities for all. Other foundations laid down in education in the past year are also paying dividends. The success and progress of both primary and secondary schools was recognised during an external review in March 2020. It verified that the schools offer a standard that is above the average and highlighted the rapid, progress that the Falkland Islands Community School has made in the last 12 months by raising aspirations for students and staff, and developing focused leadership and management at all levels. In our schools, we now have a manager specifically for Camp Education, a new leadership structure, and a quality and performance manager. Progress measures in 2019 remained good, with the Falkland Islands Community School achieving a positive score for the third year in a row, placing it in the “above average” band of all UK schools for progress. Students who study overseas continue to be great ambassadors. Numbers have remained stable with 20 students in Further Education and 38 in Higher Education. Of the eight students who completed University in 2019, 5 achieved 1st class degrees and 3 achieved 2nd class degrees in the upper division. This is the highest performing cohort in the last 5 years. We have invested strongly in our Early Years sector. The Falklands’ first Early Years conference in January gave prominence to this crucial stage in child development. The first inspections against the standards from the recent Child Minding and Day Care regulations were positive. This has exemplified the engagement of providers in key learning from the conference and from training courses. There have been 50 enrolments from the sector on local courses with Falkland College; and 14 are now qualified in caring for children. The Early Years development project has now seen the first capital grants awarded, amounting to over £500,000 in investment. Private childcare providers can now build and maintain premises that offer a safe environment; are fit for purpose and enable the sector to continue to develop the quality of their provision. Safety and security Mr Speaker, I would now like to address the topic of public safety and island security. Our police have continued to embed good practice and professional development to build on the positive 2019 review of the Royal Falkland Islands Police Force. Community policing is at the heart of all the RFIP does and in February, a public perception survey was undertaken to further inform its work. There is a growing confidence in the police and there is a high level of intelligence sharing between the Police, MOD and Customs in support of protecting the Falklands. Further work on refining career progression for local staff continues as the RFIP seeks to provide a workplace that rewards hard work and talent. Among a larger complement of dedicated staff, there are now five local police officers, a local station enquiry officer and three local reserve constables. In addition the RFIP continues to develop its capabilities to tackle a range of complex policing demands, including protection and safeguarding of children. Turning to the Falkland Islands Defence Force, it has continued to make good progress modernising training and equipment. Significant progress has been made in relation to ensuring consistency between FIDF training standards and those of the Ministry of Defence with an independently verified training regime to UK military standards and joint exercises taking place with the Resident Infantry Company. The FIDF played a full and active part in the BFSAI capability day in late 2019. Our Fire and Rescue service maintains a strong complement of retained fire officers, which is a credit to both the service and the Islands. One example of their professionalism and courage that I observed personally was demonstrated with the significant gorse fire earlier this year, where swift action in the early hours of the morning prevented loss of life and serious damage. The Service has also received its new fire appliance, a significant investment of government. Our capacity as a government to prepare for and manage emergencies was bolstered this year, with an Emergency Planning Manager coming into post just prior to the pandemic, bringing a wealth of experience and knowledge that has served us well in 2020. Customs and Immigration is also part of our security – and its work has included rolling out an electronic ship’s reporting system for certain vessels, assisting exporters registering with the European Union’s Registered Export Scheme, and revising the registration procedures of ships in the Falkland Islands. Work continues implementing the Immigration Ordinance and modernising practices and procedures. Such work is essential to the economic development of the Islands which needs ready access to a pool of qualified workers. I am pleased to report that during the past year, a large number of persons successfully sought Permanent Residence Permits and Falkland Islands Status, bolstering our permanent population. I would be remiss if I did not mention that the Falkland Islands are now in sight of the final stages of the Demining project. While it is wonderful that the Islands will soon be mine free - it will be with a sad heart that we say farewell to so many brave men, many of whom have spent a decade dedicated to safeguarding future generations of Falkland Islanders. Legal and regulation I would also like to highlight the work of our Legal and Legislative teams which supports so much of Government and helps provide an enabling legislative and regulatory environment for social and economic development on the Islands. It has indeed been an extraordinarily busy year further complicated by changes brought upon by COVID-19. The teams have worked across government to improve awareness of the policy-to-legislation process and in this regard a new Legal Policy Advisor post has been approved. Going forward, the Government will progress proposals to provide for registers of beneficial ownership of companies, to comply with international good practice. Further amendments to tax legislation will seek to ensure that the Falkland Islands remains a competitive jurisdiction in which to do business. And further improvements are proposed to the laws governing the maritime sector, and fisheries licensing. Our statutes database has been successfully maintained, ensuring access to the law for all. A large package of maritime sector legislation was approved, including greater protection for the environment and for the safety of all those working in the sector. Further improvements were made in telecommunications law and a Spectrum Management Framework was also published this year, ensuring this critical national service will be properly managed. A comprehensive strategic review of broadband resulted in FIG’s decision to invest £3m over three years to increase broadband provision for residents, in many cases doubling data allowances. The Regulator continues to work with Sure to ensure it complies with its licence obligations, and responds to specific issues and concerns, including those raised by the public. Regulations were put in place to update the arrangements for air accident investigation to comply with international standards, while the International Civil Aviation Organisation and Air Safety Support International successfully audited the Falkland Islands Civil Aviation Department. This work is part of the assurance and compliance framework that ensures that all civil aviation operators based in or who visit the Islands keep people as safe as possible. Civil service Turning to our civil service, it remains dedicated to delivering on the Islands Plan. The value of the work, the professionalism and the dedication of government staff has surely been exemplified during the pandemic response where the Civil Service has performed to an exceptionally high standard, developing and implementing important policy measures and new operational procedures in a very short space of time, and under extreme pressure brought about by remote working and social distancing. The ability of our officers to go above and beyond has been extraordinarily reassuring, with many examples of inspiring leadership. But above all, it has been a fantastic example of teamwork. Going forward the Government will continue efforts to recruit and retain talented individuals in order to maintain and improve upon these high standards. The Government will continue to encourage Falkland Islanders to enter the Public Service and to take up key positions and leadership roles. Attracting talent requires modern, equitable human resource practices and procedures. To that end a refreshed management code has been completed. The Government will continue to invest in and develop the Public Service, helping to retain existing staff, and encouraging prospective employees to consider the Falkland Islands Government as a progressive, ambitious career choice. Partnerships and COVID-19 Mr. Speaker, as I pointed out in last year’s address to this Assembly, the Government could not fulfil its aims and ambitions without the input and support of partner organizations. Partnerships enable the Falkland Island Government to build upon its resources and capabilities by leveraging those of others and, by working together, achieve so much more. Such partnerships are in evidence across a wide range of routine day-to-day government activities. However, let me take a few moments now to talk about something that was definitely not routine: namely the COVID-19 pandemic. In so doing I hope to be able to touch upon a few of the many examples of how partnerships and team work have helped the Falkland Islands navigate their way through the global crisis to date. The response by Falkland Islands residents and the Falkland Islands Government together with partners and colleagues at BFSAI, the United Kingdom Government and the private sector has been an impressive example of how organizations and people can achieve so much when working as a team. Members recognised that confidence in the government and its processes was crucial in carrying the support of the public for measures enacted. To that end, the Government’s Infectious Diseases Plan was refreshed, and importantly made public at a very early stage. The response has been tremendous. People have followed public health guidance and responded to measures that represented significant disruption to normal life. There has been – understandably – a great deal of focus on our medical resources and capabilities over the last few months and I would like to acknowledge that our hospital has done a tremendous job in reconfiguring to handle a potentially large number of patients who might need intensive care while at the same time maintaining core services. Since the outbreak of the global pandemic, KEMH has successfully augmented its capacity with new equipment, and further drugs and medical supplies, bolstered by a British Army medical team. Partnerships… The Government thanks the United Kingdom for rapidly testing more than 400 samples via the South Atlantic Airbridge during the initial stages of the response. Critically, in May the Falkland Islands was able to shift to testing for COVID-19 on island, with the UK Government donating a testing platform. This was a crucial step: the ability to process tests here is a game changer. The King Edward Memorial Hospital now has the capability to test suspect cases and get results in as little as 24 hours, speeding up public health measures. Partnerships… As the crisis unfolded, 651 cruise ship passengers on four vessels found themselves stranded by the closure of their planned ports. Together the Falkland Islands Government, the tour operators, local businesses, Air Safety Support International, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, and BFSAI worked to arrange humanitarian charter flights to repatriate the stranded passengers and ensuring that it could happen while ensuring no risk to the population. Partnerships… Of course, the COVID-19 response has been broad ranging across every government department on the Islands while in the United Kingdom FIGO has played an important COVID-19 role liaising with UK politicians and officials and helping to facilitate travel needed by Islanders, especially our students and medical patients. Partnerships… The machinery of government has also proved flexible, with Executive Council meeting far more often, deliberating on what must seem like a year’s worth of normal policy in a very compressed timescale. Teamwork… The Government has also worked closely with the private sector throughout the crisis engaging with the Chamber of Commerce, the Falkland Islands Tourist Board, the Falkland Islands Tourism Association and FIFCA to ensure that their perspectives are fully understood in order to better inform government policy responses. Partnerships… The Government and the Falkland Islands Development Corporation have also worked together to deliver various private sector support packages designed to help workers and businesses weather the storm. Partnerships… Wrap up I would like to close by emphasising how well the Falkland Islands has done in the past year. The Government continues to make tangible progress on The Islands Plan. The Government continues with this Budget to deliver a stable and prudent fiscal approach with an eye to our long-term future. The Government continues to work with our people to realise their ambitions, and with our partners here and internationally. And we have seen the value of all this in the past few months, in rising admirably to the challenges of COVID-19. I would like to close with a few words about an event in February which I think says much about this country. On February 16 there was a huge turnout for the Port Louis to Stanley 175th birthday celebrations. Falkland Islanders joined a cavalcade. It was a journey not without mishap. Vehicles became bogged. As I experienced myself, there was always someone on hand to drag clear the less fortunate. This is the Falklands’ way – a community honouring its past but with an eye on making steady progress into the future. I am sure that will never change."
"Boris Johnson","Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 10 June 2020","10 June 2020","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-statement-at-the-coronavirus-press-conference-10-june-2020","Coronavirus press conference 10 June 2020 Good evening, two weeks ago, I set out the progress we as a country have made against our five tests for adjusting the lockdown, and the measures we could introduce as a result. And today, I want to update you again on those five tests and set out some further changes we can now make. So can I have the first slide please? The five tests are designed, as you know, to ensure that any changes to the lockdown are careful, proportionate, and safe. They combine analysis of the latest data on the spread of the disease with assessments of how well we are placed to meet the operational challenges posed by the virus. We must do everything in our power to avoid a second peak of infection that overwhelms the NHS - because that would lead to more lives lost, more families in mourning, and more disruption to our economy and way of life. Next slide please. Our first test is to protect the NHS’s ability to cope, so that we are confident that we are able to provide sufficient critical care and specialist treatment right across the UK. It’s thanks to the efforts of those working in the NHS that we can still be confident the NHS can cope. On 7 June, 443 people were admitted to hospital with coronavirus in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, down from 628 two weeks earlier, and down from a peak of 3,431 on 1 April. And on 9 June, 492 patients with coronavirus were in mechanical ventilation beds in the UK, down from 848 two weeks earlier, and down from a peak of 3,301 on 12 April. So that means we are still meeting the first test. Next slide please. Our second test is to see a sustained and consistent fall in the daily death rates from COVID-19 so we are confident that we have moved beyond the peak. And of those who have tested positive for coronavirus, across all settings, I am sad to say that 41,128 have now died. That’s an increase of 245 fatalities since yesterday. As measured by a 7-day rolling average, the UK daily death rate now stands at 200, down from 300 two weeks ago, and down from a peak of 943 on 14 April. So the death rate has continued to fall, and so the second test is still being met. Next slide please. Our third test is to receive reliable data from SAGE showing that the rate of infection - the number of people catching Covid - is decreasing to manageable levels across the board. In total, 290,143 people have now tested positive for coronavirus, which is an increase of 1,003 cases since yesterday. The seven day rolling average of new positive cases found through testing is now 1,419, down from 2,416 two weeks ago, and down from a peak of 5,195 in the first week of May. In a moment, Sir Patrick will talk us through SAGE’s latest assessment of the R and other evidence on infection rates. Based on the various data available, the government is satisfied the third test is being met. Next slide please. Our fourth test is that we must be confident that the range of operational challenges, including on testing capacity and Personal Protective Equipment, are in hand, with supply able to meet future demand. Yesterday 170,379 tests were carried out or posted out across the UK, compared to around 12,000 at the start of April. The total now stands at 6,042,622. Tomorrow the Health Secretary will provide an update on how NHS Test and Trace is performing. On PPE, we have secured over 150 deals with new suppliers around the world and procured 2.2 billion items of PPE to be manufactured domestically. Despite the immensely frustrating difficulties we have faced with PPE and testing in the past, this progress means we are now satisfied that the fourth test is being met - though of course we remain vigilant. Next slide please. Our fifth and final test is that we must be confident that any adjustments to the current measures will not risk a second peak of infections that overwhelms the NHS. I am grateful to the Chief Scientific Adviser and the Chief Medical Officer for their advice on the measures I am about to set out – and on this basis I can confirm the Government judges we have met the fifth test. Therefore, the Government is satisfied that all five tests are still being met and we can proceed with the following further adjustments to the lockdown in England. A month ago I set out our roadmap to recovery and that explained the gradual steps we would take to ease the lockdown, as the data and the evidence allows. The measures it contained were all conditional on continued progress in tackling the virus. We are continuing to follow our roadmap, while adjusting our approach as we need to, as we always said we would. Although we are tackling this virus as one United Kingdom, it remains the case that the devolved administrations are responsible for lockdown in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. And it is right that they move at the right pace for them, according to their circumstances. For that reason, the specific measures I am about to set out apply in England only. First, on retail, shops. This has been the most challenging period for shops and high streets in our history. Never before have all shops been ordered to shut in this way. It has now been 82 days since we asked these shops to close their doors and I know the toll this has taken. Which is why I am so pleased that, as the Business Secretary confirmed yesterday, we can now allow all shops to reopen from Monday. It is vital that establishments should ensure they are meeting Covid Secure guidelines before they reopen. That way we can keep staff and customers safe while we get retail going. Second, on social contact. I know how difficult the past months have been for people cut off from their friends and family. Last Monday, we relaxed the rules on meeting outdoors so that groups of up to 6 could gather, provided they are socially distant. We did so in the knowledge that transmission of the virus is much lower outdoors, so we could make this change in a safe way. But there are still too many people, particularly those who live by themselves, who are lonely and struggling with being unable to see friends and family. From this weekend, we will allow single adult households - so adults living alone or single parents with children under 18 - to form a “support bubble” with one other household. All those in a support bubble will be able to act as if they live in the same household - meaning they can spend time together inside each others’ homes and do not need to stay 2 metres apart. I want to stress that support bubbles must be exclusive - meaning you cannot switch the household you are in a bubble with or connect with multiple households. And if any member of the support bubble develops symptoms, all members of the bubble will need to follow the normal advice on household isolation. We are making this change to support those who are particularly lonely as a result of lockdown measures. It is a targeted intervention to limit the most harmful effects of the current social restrictions. It is emphatically not designed for people who don’t qualify to start meeting inside other people’s homes - that remains against the law. Unfortunately, we cannot advise anyone who is shielding to form a support bubble at this stage, given their particular vulnerability to the virus. However, I want to say I know how hard it is for those of you who are shielding, and we will say more next week about the arrangements that will be in place for you beyond the end of June. Third, on outdoor attractions. Because the risk of transmission is lower outdoors, we can open up some more outdoor attractions for people to enjoy this summer. So from Monday, we will allow outdoor attractions where people can stay in their cars, such as safari parks and drive-in cinemas to open. I am very grateful to the zoo industry for their cooperation and forbearance, and am happy to confirm that they too can reopen from Monday, provided visitor numbers are managed and safeguards put in place. That includes keeping indoor areas such as reptile houses closed and facilitating social distancing. Finally, we will allow places of worship to open for individual prayer this weekend. And I hope that will be of some comfort to those of faith who have been unable to go to their place of worship. As set out in our roadmap, the next set of changes - Step 3 - will not begin until 4 July at the earliest, as the evidence allows. I know that these changes are only incremental and that some of you, many of you, may be hoping and waiting for more. I also know that people will once again find anomalies or apparent anomalies in what people can and cannot do. And as I have said before, I’m afraid that is just inevitable when we are only able to give people a small amount of the freedoms that they usually enjoy. We will continue to remain cautious and measure the effect of the changes that we make. And as I’ve always said, we won’t hesitate to apply the brakes if that is what the situation requires. That has meant moving slower than we would have liked in some areas. It is because the rate of infection is not yet quite low enough, and because we are not able to change our social distancing advice including smaller class sizes in schools, that we are not proceeding with our ambition to bring back all primary pupils at least for some weeks before the summer holidays. Instead we are working with teachers to bring back as many pupils as we can within those smaller class sizes. We do fully intend to bring all children back to school in September, provided the progress we are making continues, which I hope it will. That is our focus and it is consistent with the approach that has been taken by many other countries in Europe. In the meantime we must stick to our roadmap. I urge everyone to continue to show restraint and respect the rules which are designed to keep us all safe. It’s only because of the restraint that everyone, you all have shown so far that we are able to move gradually out of this lockdown. So please, to repeat what you’ve heard so many times before, stay alert, maintain social distancing and keep washing your hands. Help control the virus by getting tested if you have symptoms and isolating if you are contacted by NHS Test and Trace. Then, if we all do that together, we will all save lives and begin to rebuild our country. And I’ll now hand over to Sir Patrick."
"Boris Johnson","International Ministers discuss a new Coalition for the Sahel","12 June 2020","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/international-ministers-discuss-a-new-coalition-for-the-sahel","The speech below was delivered by Africa Minister James Duddridge on Friday 12 June at a virtual meeting of international Ministers to discuss the new Coalition for the Sahel – an international initiative to support the security, political and development efforts in the region. The Sahel region is vulnerable to insecurity and drought, and encompasses Mauritania, Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger and Chad. Speech It is excellent to be with you to welcome the Coalition for the Sahel. I am delighted that, today, the UK Minister for the Armed Forces, James Heappey, announced the extension of the UK’s deployment of three Chinook helicopters to Operation Barkhane. As you know, the UK is also deploying 250 troops to MINUSMA later this year. Beyond our security contributions, the UK is also the third largest humanitarian donor to the region and has provided over £500 million in bilateral development and humanitarian assistance since 2015. This support continues to grow. A significant part of our £764 million contribution to the global COVID-19 effort will be channelled to the region. And I’m delighted that the UK has just disbursed £10.5 million of funding to Education Cannot Wait, for use in the Sahel. This money, which delivers on Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s commitment at last year’s G7 meeting, will be fast-tracked to help children access education in Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso. The establishment of the Sahel Coalition is a positive step that the UK welcomes. I would like to highlight three ways in which the Coalition can support progress in the region. First, it provides an opportunity for us to develop a joint vision for tackling instability and driving forward development in the region. This will increase coherence and allow us to hold each other to account on our commitments. Second, it will help us to focus on tackling the drivers of instability. I saw the potential for joint work to address these issues when I visited Mali in 2016 and saw international efforts to build Malian security capacity and, more recently, when I was in Nouakchott in February for the G5 and Sahel Alliance meetings. I am pleased to see that the Coalition’s structures reinforce the principle of ownership from those in the region. Third, the Coalition provides a timely opportunity to make sure that respect for humanitarian principles and human rights law are woven into every aspect of our activity. We welcome that this is reflected in the Coalition’s terms of reference. Humanitarian actors must be able to access those most in need, through a neutral, needs-based response. We welcome the role the Coalition will play in the Sahel and look forward to contributing to its important work. Thank you.

"Boris Johnson","Prime Minister's article in the Telegraph: 15 June 2020","15 June 2020","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-article-in-the-telegraph-15-june-2020","It was utterly absurd that a load of far-right thugs and bovver boys yesterday converged on London with a mission to protect the statue of Winston Churchill. It was right that a good number should have been arrested. They were violent. They were aggressive towards the police. They were patently racist. There is nothing that can excuse their behaviour. And yet it was also, frankly, absurd and deplorable that the statue of Winston Churchill should have been in any plausible danger of attack. It was outrageous that anyone could even have claimed that the statue needed protection. It was and is miserable to see his statue entombed in its protective sheath. It is true that the monument has been covered up several times before, in anticipation of trouble, after consultation with the Mayor’s office and English Heritage, because the police believe that is the safest and simplest thing to do. But many people will look at that image and feel a sense of bewilderment. Why attack Churchill? What has the world come to when one of this country’s greatest ever leaders – perhaps our greatest - has to be shielded from the wrath of the mob? We all understand the depth of feeling that has been exposed by the killing, in Minnesota, of George Floyd. No one who cares about this country can ignore the many thousands of people who have joined the Black Lives Movement to protest peacefully, as most of them have, in the last few days. It is no use just saying that we have made huge progress in tackling racism. There is much more that we need to do; and we will. It is time for a cross-governmental commission to look at all aspects of inequality – in employment, in health outcomes, in academic and all other walks of life. We need to tackle the substance of the problem, not the symbols. We need to address the present, not attempt to re-write the past – and that means we cannot and must not get sucked into never-ending debate about which well-known historical figure is sufficiently pure or politically correct to remain in public view. Where will it end? Are we supposed to haul down Cromwell who killed so many thousands of people in Ireland? What about Nelson and all the other innumerable reminders of this country’s imperial past? Take the case of Ayuba Suleiman Diallo, whose portrait hangs in Room 15 of the National Portrait Gallery. He was a native of the Gambia who was known and admired in C18 London as a translator of Arab texts. He was also, originally, a slaver himself. Does that mean he should be purged from the Gallery? My point is that our history is immensely complex, and modern Britain is a product of a vast conglomerate of ideas and beliefs – not all of which look good in the light of today. Yes, Churchill expressed all sorts of views over his immense career – and bear in mind that he entered parliament under Queen Victoria and left it under Queen Elizabeth - which are totally unacceptable to modern ears. As it happens, he generally changed with the times. He changed his view on India, and her capacity for independence; and whatever he may have said about Islam in the 1890s, he also built the Regent’s Park Mosque in the 1940s. And above all – as so many have rightly pointed out – it is the height of lunacy to accuse him of racism, when he stood alone against a racist tyranny that without his resistance would have overwhelmed this country and the rest of Europe. He was a hero, and I expect I am not alone in saying that I will resist with every breath in my body any attempt to remove that statue from Parliament Square, and the sooner his protective shielding comes off the better. It is not just that is wrong to destroy public property by violence. I am also extremely dubious about the growing campaign to edit or photoshop the entire cultural landscape. If we start purging the record and removing the images of all but those whose attitudes conform to our own, we are engaged in a great lie, a distortion of our history – like some public figure furtively trying to make themselves look better by editing their own Wikipedia entry. Would it not be better and more honest to ask our children to understand the context, to explain the mixture of good and bad in the career of Churchill and everyone else? And rather than tear some people down, we should build others up, and celebrate the people who we in this generation believe are worthy of memorial. We have brilliant sculptors and artists. Why should they not be commissioned to make fitting additions to the landscape and cityscape? Take the great courtyard in the Foreign and Commonwealth office, where stone statues of British explorers and imperialists look down from the niches. Many of the niches are for some reason unfilled. Rather than tear down the past, why not add some of the men and women – most often BAME – who helped to make our modern Commonwealth and our modern world? Isn’t that a more cheerful approach? This new vogue for politically correct iconoclasm is not just dispiriting, and unfair, and often ahistorical. Worst of all, it is a total distraction from the matter in hand. It does nothing for BAME people to go around mutilating statues, or campaigning against this or that cultural relic. There are far greater and more important battles. In the last ten years we have seen a big expansion in BAME students at our universities; more young black kids excelling in the most challenging subjects at school. The struggle now is to turn that into the universal narrative and the universal expectation – a story of success and not discrimination. That means taking seriously the serious points that are raised by the marchers. It means addressing racism and discrimination, and stamping it out. But it does not mean wasting time in delectable academic disputation about the life and opinions of every historical personality currently immortalised in bronze or stone. Let’s fight racism, but leave our heritage broadly in peace. If we really want to change it, there are democratic means available in this country – thanks, by the way, to Winston Churchill."
"Boris Johnson","Prime Minister's statement to the House of Commons: 16 June 2020","16 June 2020","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-statement-to-the-house-of-commons-16-june-2020","Mr Speaker, Before I begin, I am sure the whole House will join me in paying tribute to the memory of Jo Cox, who was cruelly murdered four years ago today. Her sister, Kim Leadbeater, spoke for us all when she urged everyone to remember Jo by pulling together with “compassion and kindness”. I was concerned to learn that the Hon Member for East Dunbartonshire is now in hospital: we send her our best wishes. Mr Speaker, with permission, I will make a statement about the ambitions of a Global Britain and the lessons of the Covid-19 pandemic. We are living through a daily demonstration of how events on the far side of the world influence not only British security and prosperity, but something as elemental as the state of our health, and whether we can go to work or buy our daily bread. This crisis offers vivid proof of the seminal importance of international engagement and exactly why our country must perform its global role. I have begun the biggest review of our foreign, defence and development policy since the end of the Cold War, designed to maximise our influence and integrate all the strands of our international effort. The overriding aim is to bring this country’s strengths and expertise to bear on the world’s biggest problems, seizing the opportunities of Britain’s presidency of the G7 next year and the UN climate change conference, COP26, which we will host in Glasgow. The UK possesses the third biggest aid budget and diplomatic network in the world: we owe it to our people to make best use of these assets, which scarcely any of our peers can match. The British taxpayer has the right to expect that we achieve the maximum value with every pound we spend. One cardinal lesson of the pandemic is that distinctions between diplomacy and overseas development are artificial and outdated. For instance, to protect ourselves against another calamity, the UK will need to work alongside our friends to strengthen international bodies like the World Health Organization, and help vulnerable countries to improve their health systems and achieve greater resilience. It makes no sense to ask whether this amounts to aid or foreign policy: they are one and the same endeavour, and they’re designed to achieve the same goals, which are right in themselves and serve our national interest. On 4th June I chaired a virtual summit of the global vaccine alliance, which raised enough money to immunise 300 million children. I doubt whether any other occasion will save more lives, and avoid more suffering, or produce a better example of the good this country can do by its international engagement – in the true and broad sense - alongside our friends. And yet today – as anyone with experience of it will know - a dividing line between aid and foreign policy runs through our whole system, with our Department for International Development working independently from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, and our aid budget parcelled out between different arms of Whitehall. DFID outspends the Foreign Office more than four times over and yet no single decision-maker in either department is able to unite our efforts or take a comprehensive overview. We give as much aid to Zambia as we do to Ukraine, though the latter is vital for European security. We give ten times as much aid to Tanzania as we do to the six countries of the Western Balkans, who are acutely vulnerable to Russian meddling. And, regardless of the merits of these decisions, no single department is currently empowered to judge whether they make sense or not: we tolerate an inherent risk of our left and right hands working independently. Faced with this crisis today – and the opportunities that lie ahead – we have a responsibility to ask whether our current arrangements, dating back to 1997, still maximise British influence. Those well-intentioned decisions of 23 years ago were right for their time. They paved the way for Britain to meet the UN target of spending 0.7 percent of national income on aid, a goal that was achieved by the Coalition Government in 2013 and has been maintained ever since - including this year - and which remains our commitment. Yet those judgments date from a relatively benign era when China’s economy was still smaller than Italy’s and the West was buoyed by victory in the Cold War. We must now strengthen our position in an intensely competitive world by making sensible changes, and so I have decided to merge DFID with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to create a new department, the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office. This will unite our aid with our diplomacy and bring them together in our international effort. DFID has amassed world class expertise and all of its people can take pride in how they have to helped transform the lives of hundreds of millions of people around the world. To select but a few examples, they have striven to protect millions of children across the world from polio – which is now on the verge of global eradication – and they have paved the way for millions of girls to attend school for the first time in countries like Pakistan, as I have seen for myself. They have done their utmost to ease the suffering in Syria and in Sierra Leone they were central to the defeat of an outbreak of the Ebola virus. All this amounts to the finest demonstration of British values, following in the great tradition of the country that ended the slave trade and resisted totalitarianism. And it is precisely that ambition, vision and expertise that will now be at the heart of a new department, taking forward the work of UK Aid to reduce poverty, and that will remain central to our mission. The Foreign Secretary will be empowered to decide which countries receive – or cease to receive – British aid, while delivering a single UK strategy for each country, overseen by the National Security Council, which I chair. Those strategies will be implemented on the ground by the relevant UK Ambassador, who will lead all of the Government’s work in the host country. And in this we are following the examples of Australia, Canada and New Zealand, all of whom run their development programmes from their foreign ministries. And we will align other British assets overseas, including our trade commissioners, who will come under the authority of the UK ambassador, bringing more coherence to our international presence. Now, amid the pandemic, this House will ask whether this is the right moment to reorganise Whitehall. In reality, this crisis has already imposed fundamental changes on the way that we operate and if there is one further lesson, it is that a whole-of-government approach and getting maximum value for the British taxpayer is just as important abroad as it is at home. This is exactly the moment when we must mobilise every one of our national assets, including our aid budget and expertise, to safeguard British interests and values overseas - and the best possible instrument for doing that will be a new department charged with using all the tools of British influence to seize the opportunities ahead. Mr Speaker, I commend this statement to the House."
"Boris Johnson","Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 16 June 2020","16 June 2020","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-statement-at-the-coronavirus-press-conference-16-june-2020","coronavirus press conference 16 June 2020 Good evening, I am delighted to be joined today by the Chief Scientific Adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, and by Professor Peter Horby, from the University of Oxford’s Centre for Tropical Medicine and Global Health. Today I’m actually going to let them do most of the talking as they have some news to share on a new treatment for coronavirus. But I’ll start by updating you briefly on the latest data. Can I have the first slide please? 6,981,493 tests for coronavirus carried out or posted out in the UK. This includes 113,107 carried out or posted out yesterday. 298,136 have tested positive, an increase of 1,279 cases since yesterday. The second slide shows the latest data from hospitals: 410 people were admitted to hospital with coronavirus in England, Wales and Northern Ireland on 13 June, that’s down from 438 a week earlier, and down from a peak of 3,432 on 1 April. 385 coronavirus patients are currently in mechanical ventilation beds in the UK, down from 513 a week ago, and down from a peak of 3,301 on 12 April. The third slide shows what is happening in hospitals across the country: There are now 5,254 people in hospital with coronavirus in the UK, down 16% from 6,282 a week ago and down from a peak of 20,698 on 12 April. The fourth slide shows the daily figures for those who have sadly lost their lives after testing positive for coronavirus: And across all settings, the total number of deaths now stands at 41,969. That’s an increase of 233 fatalities since yesterday. Although those figures are very sad, they do show that we are making good progress in controlling the spread of the virus. Tests are up and cases are down. Hospital admissions are down. The numbers of patients in hospital overall - and specifically those on mechanical ventilation beds - are both down. And of course while each death is one too many, deaths are coming down too. That progress of course has only been possible thanks to the dedication of the British people as we work together to beat this virus. By observing the lockdown, and sacrificing contact with friends and families, everybody has played their part in bringing the virus under control. It is critical now that we hold our nerve – and we don’t throw away the progress we have made. On the 11 May I set out our plan to help our country recover and we are working through it, carefully and deliberately. At each stage we have only proceeded when the evidence suggests it is safe to do so, ensuring our five tests for adjusting the lockdown continue to be met. And yesterday it was great to see our shops open their doors again. Our retail sector has done a fantastic job to make sure they are Covid Secure, meaning they can open in a safe way for staff and for customers. It is great to see so many people out shopping whilst observing social distancing – and that is so important to limiting the spread of the virus. It has also been very good to see more, and more children back at school this week, with some secondary pupils returning for face-to-face contact with their teachers ahead of the exams next year. And I want to say to all parents whose children are eligible to return to school, I want to assure you it is safe – and there is no need for your kids to miss out on their education, I hope they will go to school. I know that people want us to go further – with our changes to social distancing measures and I am all too aware the 2 metre rule has big implications for schools and many other sectors, and I absolutely hear those concerns and will do everything in my power to get us back to normal as soon possible. But we must proceed carefully, and according to our plan. I am still committed to the central goal to get back to life as close to normal as possible, for as many people as possible, as fast and fairly as possible… and in a way that minimises the risk of a new epidemic, minimises the risk to life and maximises our chances of a string economic and social recovery. Our plan sets out that the next step of adjusting lockdown - for personal care, for the hospitality and leisure sector, for gatherings in places of worship and other public places – a lot more to come and that as you know will happen no sooner than 4 July. I remain committed to that plan, and will say more soon about how we intend to take it forward. Today, the global efforts to find a long-term solution to the pandemic continue, through a vaccine or effective treatment. And I am delighted that the biggest breakthrough yet has been made by a fantastic team of scientists right here in the UK. I am not really qualified to announce on this drug and its effects but I will ask Sir Patrick and Professor Horby to say more in a moment. But I am so proud of these British scientists, backed by UK Government funding, who have led the first robust clinical trial anywhere in the world to find a coronavirus treatment proven to reduce the risk of death. And I am very grateful to the thousands of patients in this country who volunteered for the trials – thank you. This drug - dexamethasone – can now be made available across the NHS. And we have taken steps to ensure we have enough supplies, even in the event of a second peak. Of course, while the chances of dying from Covid-19 have been significantly reduced by this treatment, they are still far too high. So we must redouble our research efforts and we certainly will. But today, there is genuine cause to celebrate a great, British achievement and the benefits it will bring not just in this country but around the world. I’ll now hand over to Sir Patrick."
"Boris Johnson","The sustainable recovery, investor collaboration on COVID-19 recovery and the climate emergency","17 June 2020","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/the-sustainable-recovery-investor-collaboration-on-covid-19-recovery-and-the-climate-emergency","Good afternoon everyone and thank you to the London Stock Exchange for organising this event. Many people across the world are looking to governments during this global emergency to provide leadership and clarity to overcome the unprecedented challenges that we are facing. Countries across the globe have taken the extraordinary measures to shut down large swathes of their economies in order to combat the coronavirus public health emergency. In the UK, we did this on 23 March (2020) and we also launched a series of major policy initiatives to support businesses and individuals through the pandemic. Our aim has been to protect businesses, workers and consumers through these measures. And while we will sadly not be able to save every business and every job, we hope that our measures have provided some certainty and consistency of support. So as we emerge from the public health pandemic, we not only want to support businesses to bounce back as quickly as possible, but also to do so in a way that meets the UK’s big, structural challenges. This is why we want to deliver a green recovery. And we want to do that in partnership with business and finance. I am here today, as the Business Secretary in the UK government, and as President for COP26, to underline the role you, the business community, can play in that joint endeavour. Because finance and investment are the lifeblood of net zero projects – and we can only meet this challenge together. I know the role finance can play in delivering this change, having worked in corporate finance myself for over 15 years before I came into politics. I know the drive to deliver a return on investment and the search for growth areas in the economy. When I worked in the banking sector, certainly at the start of it, green finance was a nascent initiative. But things have changed and they do change. So much so that today we have a former Governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, whose warning that if some companies fail to adjust to a net zero world, they will fail to exist. The risks are clear, but actually the opportunities are clearer yet. And actually it is worth pointing out that since 1990, the UK economy has grown by 75% but at the same time we have cut emissions by 43%. In the UK we have shown that green growth is possible. The International Energy Agency has estimated that $13.5 trillion of public and private investment in the global energy sector alone will be required between 2015 and 2030 to meet the Paris Agreement targets. And the International Renewable Energy Agency recently found that renewable energy would bring returns of between 3-8 dollars on every dollar invested. BlackRock found that in the first quarter of 2020, during the pandemic, 94% of a set of sustainable funds outperformed their non-sustainable counterparts. So my message is simple, and I say this as a former financier to the current cohort: the UK is the place for you to invest in green assets. And you will be welcomed and right to do so. My department, the business department, is leading work to support a green recovery. Helping our world-leading offshore wind industry reach 40GW by 2030. Building the first fully-deployed carbon capture storage cluster by the mid-2020s. Supporting energy intensive industries as they move to low-carbon techniques. Helping to improve the energy-efficiency of homes, schools and hospitals. And delivering 2 million new high-quality jobs in clean growth over the next decade. Today, nearly half a million people across our country are employed in the low carbon economy and its supply chains. And recovering from this pandemic makes these projects more necessary and more important than ever. And many of them require private finance to deliver. Which is why I am currently engaging with businesses across the country on the opportunities that arise from our net zero commitment and how they can support a green recovery. And we will continue to do so, so I invite all of you to contribute to our thinking by submitting written responses to the questions that we have set out on GOV.UK, and if you’d like to know how to do it then please get in touch with us. But of course this is alongside our Green Finance Strategy, which aims to accelerate investment in green infrastructure. And my department will continue to work at pace to deliver these policy commitments over the course of this Parliament. And now, as we look forward to COP26 next November (2021), our aim is to ramp up ambition towards a climate-resilient, zero-carbon economy. We want all countries to submit more ambitious Nationally Determined Contributions, committing to further cuts in carbon emissions by 2030. With all nations committing to reaching net zero emissions as soon as possible. And ahead of COP26, we have defined 5 areas which need particular attention: clean energy clean transport nature based solutions adaptation and resilience and, of course, making all of this possible, finance Whenever I mention the 5 campaigns, I always make a point of mentioning finance last. Because, from preserving ecosystems, to manufacturing electric cars and solar panels, it all needs to be paid for. Again and again, I have seen first-hand how finance turns good ideas into action. In January this year, I helped launch East Africa’s first ‘green bond’ on the Nairobi securities exchange, followed by its dual listing on the London Stock Exchange. Helping to fund environmentally friendly housing in Nairobi. And, through the Powering Past Coal Alliance, the UK has worked with Climate Action 100+, Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change, UN Principles for Responsible Investment and Ceres, all of whom are here today, to help align coal finance and investments with the aims of the Paris Agreement. So your contribution will be absolutely central to a successful COP26 summit next year. And ahead of COP, we want to see investors take crucial actions, such as setting a target for net zero and publishing a clear transition plan on how to achieve this. And this will be underpinned by scenario analyses and of course, methodology reviews. And while we have seen progress on the Task-Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures, this must accelerate. And I urge you all to continue signing up to the recommendations of the TCFD to build a greener and more resilient financial system. In February, I joined Mark Carney to launch the COP26 Finance Action Plan to help private finance support the global economy transition to net zero. Last year at the UN, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced a doubling of the UK’s international climate finance commitment to £11.6 billion over 2021 to 2025. This, in turn, will mobilise further finance from public and private sources. Helping us meet and indeed move beyond the 100-billion-dollar goal, as we begin discussions in the UNFCCC on the goal that will replace it from 2025. Since 2011, the UK’s international climate finance has already supported over 100 countries and helped to reduce or avoid a total of 16 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions, which is equivalent of taking 3.3 million passenger vehicles off the road for a year. Our UK Pact programme has been part of this. Since last year, it has helped financial institutions around the world drive down emissions. Projects in Mexico and China, for example, helped harmonise national definitions of green bonds with global ones. Giving global investors the confidence to invest. And I can announce today that, from August we will be launching the first round of our UK PACT Green Recovery Challenge Fund. This is a £12 million challenge fund, that British and international organisations can bid into, to support countries in Africa, Asia and South America to develop their green industries. This will major on green finance and ways that companies can increase transparency and the disclosure of financial risks. The UK government will fund the best projects and approaches to be deployed globally, and share UK expertise to support others with their own green recovery. So in conclusion I hope you take away from today the clear message that you and your organisations are absolutely vital in supporting the green recovery and transition to net zero. Not only because it’s the right policy, but because it is the right business and investment decision. Because government will stand behind you every step of the way when you make these decisions. So we can build a better world, through our economic recovery together. Thank you."
"Boris Johnson","Prime Minister's statement to the House on COVID-19: 23 June 2020","23 June 2020","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-statement-to-the-house-on-covid-19-23-june-2020","Mr Speaker, before I begin, I am sure the whole House will join me in sending our deepest condolences to the families and friends of James Furlong, Joe Ritchie-Bennett and David Wails, who were brutally killed in Reading on Saturday. To assault defenceless people in a park is not simply an act of wickedness but abject cowardice, and we will never yield to those who would seek to destroy our way of life. Mr Speaker, with permission I will update the House on the next steps in our plan to rebuild our economy and reopen our society, while waging our struggle against Covid-19. From the outset, we have trusted in the common sense and perseverance of the British people and their response has more than justified our faith. Since I set out our plan on the 11th May, we have been clear that our cautious relaxation of the guidance is entirely conditional on our continued defeat of the virus. In the first half of May, nearly 69,000 people tested positive for Covid-19 across the UK; by the first half of June, that total had fallen by nearly 70 percent to just under 22,000. The number of new infections is now declining by between 2 and 4 percent every day. Four weeks ago, an average of 1 in 400 people in the community in England had COVID-19; in the first half of June, this figure was 1 in 1,700. We created a human shield around the NHS and in turn our doctors and nurses have protected us, and together we have saved our hospitals from being overwhelmed. On the 11th May, 1,073 people were admitted to hospital in England, Wales and Northern Ireland with Covid-19, by 20th June, this had fallen by 74 per cent to 283. This pandemic has inflicted permanent scars and we mourn everyone we have lost. Measured by a seven-day rolling average, the number of daily deaths peaked at 943 on the 14th April, on 11th May it was 476, and yesterday, the rolling average stood at 130. We have ordered over 2.2 billion items of protective equipment from UK based manufacturers, many of whose production lines have been called into being to serve this new demand - and yesterday, we conducted or posted 139,659 tests, bringing the total to over 8 million. And while we remain vigilant, we do not believe there is currently a risk of a second peak of infections that might overwhelm the NHS. Taking everything together, we continue to meet our five tests and the Chief Medical Officers of all four home nations have downgraded the UK’s Covid Alert Level from four to three, meaning that we no longer face a virus spreading exponentially, though it remains in general circulation. The administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland hold responsibility for their own lockdown restrictions and they will respond to the united view of the Chief Medical Officers at their own pace, based on their own judgment, but all parts of the UK are now travelling in the same direction and we will continue to work together to ensure that everyone in our country gets the support they need. Thanks to our progress, we can now go further and safely ease the lockdown in England. At every stage, caution will remain our watchword, and each step will be conditional and reversible. Mr Speaker, given the significant fall in the prevalence of the virus, we can change the two-metre social distancing rule, from 4th July. I know this rule effectively makes life impossible for large parts of our economy, even without other restrictions. For example, it prevents all but a fraction of our hospitality industry from operating. So that is why almost two weeks ago, I asked our experts to conduct a review and I will place a summary of their conclusions in the libraries of both Houses this week. Where it is possible to keep 2 metres apart people should. But where it is not, we will advise people to keep a social distance of ‘one metre plus’, meaning they should remain one metre apart, while taking mitigations to reduce the risk of transmission. We are today publishing guidance on how businesses can reduce the risk by taking certain steps to protect workers and customers. These include, for instance, avoiding face-to-face seating by changing office layouts, reducing the number of people in enclosed spaces, improving ventilation, using protective screens and face coverings, closing non-essential social spaces, providing hand sanitiser and changing shift patterns so that staff work in set teams. And of course, we already mandate face coverings on public transport. Whilst the experts cannot give a precise assessment of how much the risk is reduced, they judge these mitigations would make “1 metre plus” broadly equivalent to the risk at 2 metres if those mitigations are fully implemented. Either will be acceptable and our guidance will change accordingly. This vital change enables the next stage of our plan to ease the lockdown. Mr Speaker, I am acutely conscious people will ask legitimate questions about why certain activities are allowed and others are not. I must ask the House to understand that the virus has no interest in these debates. Its only interest, its only ambition is to exploit any opportunities is to recapture ground that we might carelessly vacate. There is one certainty: the fewer social contacts you have, the safer you will be. My duty, our duty as the Government, is to guide the British people, balancing our overriding aim of controlling the virus against our natural desire to bring back normal life. We cannot lift all the restrictions at once, so we have to make difficult judgments, and every step is scrupulously weighed against the evidence. Our principle is to trust the British public to use their common sense in the full knowledge of the risks, remembering that the more we open up, the more vigilant we will need to be. From now on we will ask people to follow guidance on social contact instead of legislation. In that spirit we advise that from 4 July, two households of any size should be able to meet in any setting inside or out. That does not mean they must always be the same two households. It will be possible for instance to meet one set of grandparents one weekend, and the others the following weekend. We are not recommending meetings of multiple households indoors because of the risk of creating greater chains of transmission. Outside, the guidance remains that people from several households can meet in groups of up to six. and it follows that two households can also meet, regardless of size. Mr Speaker, I can tell the House that we will also re-open restaurants and pubs. All hospitality indoors will be limited to table-service, and our guidance will encourage minimal staff and customer contact. We will ask businesses to help NHS Test and Trace respond to any local outbreaks by collecting contact details from customers, as happens in other countries, and we will work with the sector to make this manageable. Almost as eagerly awaited as a pint will be a haircut, particularly by me, and so we will re-open hairdressers, with appropriate precautions, including the use of visors. We also intend to allow some other close contact services, such as nail bars, to re-open as soon as we can, when we are confident they can operate in a Covid-secure way. From 4th July, provided that no more than two households stay together, people will be free to stay overnight in self-contained accommodation, including hotels and bed & breakfasts, as well as campsites as long as shared facilities are kept clean. Most leisure facilities and tourist attractions will reopen if they can do so safely, including outdoor gyms and playgrounds, cinemas, museums, galleries, theme parks and arcades as well as libraries, social clubs and community centres. “Close proximity” venues such as nightclubs, soft-play areas, indoor gyms, swimming pools and spas will need to remain closed for now, as will bowling alleys and water parks. But my RHFs the Business and Culture Secretaries will establish taskforces with public health experts and these sectors to help them become Covid-secure and re-open as soon as possible. We will also work with the arts industry on specific guidance to enable choirs, orchestras and theatres to resume live performances as soon as possible. Recreation and sport will be allowed, but indoor facilities, including changing rooms and courts, will remain closed and people should only play close contact team sports with members of their household. Mr Speaker, I know that many have mourned the closure of places of worship, and this year, Easter, Passover and Eid all occurred during the lockdown. So I am delighted that places of worship will be able to reopen for prayer and services – including weddings with a maximum of 30 people, all subject to social distancing. Meanwhile, our courts, probation services, police stations and other public services will increasingly resume face-to-face proceedings. Wrap-around care for school age children and formal childcare will restart over the summer. Primary and secondary education will recommence in September with full attendance and those children who can already go to school should do so – because it is safe. Mr Speaker, we will publish Covid-secure guidelines for every sector that is re-opening, and slowly but surely, these measures will restore a sense of normality. After the toughest restrictions in peacetime history, we are now able to make life easier for people to see more of their friends and families and to help businesses get back on their feet and get people back into work. But the virus has not gone away. We will continue to monitor the data with the Joint Biosecurity Centre and our ever more effective Test and Trace system. And I must be clear to the House, that as we have seen in other countries, there will be flare-ups for which local measures will be needed and we will not hesitate to apply the brakes and re-introduce restrictions even at national level - if required. So I urge everyone to stay alert, control the virus and save lives. Let’s keep washing our hands, staying 2 metres apart wherever feasible, and mitigating the risks at 1 metre where not, avoiding public transport when possible, and wearing a mask when not, getting tested immediately if we have symptoms, and self-isolating if instructed by NHS Test and Trace. Today, we can say that our long national hibernation is beginning to come to an end and life is returning to our shops, streets and homes and a new, but cautious, optimism is palpable. But it would be all too easy for that frost to return and that is why we will continue to trust in the common sense and the community spirit of the British people to follow this guidance, to carry us through and see us to victory over this virus. I commend Mr Speaker this Statement to the House."
"Boris Johnson","Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 23 June 2020","23 June 2020","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-23-june-2020","The Prime Minister leading the coronavirus press conference on 23 June 2020 Good evening, Could I have the first slide please? On 16 April, we set out our five tests for adjusting the lockdown, and since then they have guided our path out of lockdown. At every stage, we have diligently assessed our progress against these five tests before making changes. It has meant that we have, so far, avoided the catastrophe of a second peak of infection that could have overwhelmed the NHS and meant so many more lives lost. Next slide please. Our first test is to protect the NHS’s ability to cope, so that we are confident that we are able to provide sufficient critical care and specialist treatment right across the UK. Well, the NHS has coped fantastically under the extraordinary pressure of this extraordinary pandemic. On 20 June, 283 people were admitted to hospital with coronavirus in England, Wales and Northern Ireland - down from 438 two weeks earlier, and down from a peak of 3,432 on 1 April. And on 22 June, 340 patients with coronavirus were in mechanical ventilation beds in the UK, down from 513 two weeks earlier, and down from a peak of 3,301 on 12 April. These numbers provide confidence that we are still meeting the first test. Next slide please. Our second test is to see a sustained and consistent fall in the daily death rates from COVID-19 so that we are confident that we have moved beyond the peak. Of those who have tested positive for coronavirus, across all settings, it saddens me to report that 42,927 have now died. 171 fatalities were reported in the 24 hours to 5pm yesterday. A further 109 deaths which occurred in April, May and June have been identified and added to the total. As measured by a 7-day rolling average, the UK daily death rate now stands at 121, down from 216 two weeks ago, and down from a peak of 943 on 14 April. The second test is, therefore, still being met. Next slide please. Our third test is to receive reliable data from SAGE showing that the rate of infection is decreasing to manageable levels across the board. In total, 306,210 people have now tested positive for coronavirus, which is an increase of 874 cases since yesterday. The seven day rolling average of new positive cases is now 1,147, down from 1,543 two weeks ago, and down from a peak of 5,195 on 14 April. Approximately one in 1,700 people in the community in England are now estimated to have the virus, down from 1 in 400 four weeks ago. SAGE believes infections across the UK are shrinking at a steady rate of between 4 and 2 per cent every day. Based on all the various data available, the government is confident the third test is being met. Next slide please. Our fourth test is that we must be confident that the range of operational challenges, including on testing capacity and Personal Protective Equipment, are in hand, with supply able to meet future demand. Yesterday 237,142 tests were carried out or posted out across the UK, compared to around 12,000 at the start of April. The new NHS Test and Trace service has already advised over 87,000 people to self-isolate who might otherwise have unwittingly transmitted the virus. We have contracted with over 175 new suppliers able to deliver PPE at the scale and pace the UK requires. And this progress means we are satisfied that the fourth test is being met. Our fifth and final test is that we must be confident that any adjustments to the current measures will not risk a second peak of infections that overwhelms the NHS. I am once again grateful for the Chief Scientific Adviser and the Chief Medical Officer for their advice on the measures I am about to set out. I can confirm the government judges we have met the fifth test and we are therefore satisfied that all five tests are still being met. On 11 May, we set out our plan to recover. That plan as you may remember set out three steps for adjusting the lockdown. Step 1 was implemented, as planned, on 13 May, enabling people to spend more time outdoors. Step 2 was implemented, as planned, in phases on 1 and 15 June. Shops have opened, children have started to return to school and people have been able to see more of their loved ones. Now Step 3 can be implemented, as planned, on 4 July. All the measures I am about to set out apply to England - the devolved administrations are responsible for adjusting lockdown in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, moving at the pace they believe is right for them. After a long period of asking you, the British public, to follow very strict and complex rules to bring coronavirus under control, we can now make life easier for people to see more of their friends and family, and to help businesses get back on their feet and people back into jobs. Critically, we can make a change to the guidance on two metres, which kept us safe while transmission of the virus was high but which can now be modified. Having considered all the evidence, while staying at two metres is preferable, we can now move to “1 metre plus” where it is not possible for us to stay two metres apart. This means staying one metre apart, plus mitigations which reduce the risk of transmission. These precautions could include installing screens, making sure people face away from each other, providing handwashing facilities, minimising the amount of time you spend with people outside your household, and of course being outdoors. On public transport, it means one metre plus wearing a face covering for mitigation, as everybody I think now understands. We are setting out COVID-Secure guidance to help businesses take the measures that are right for them. We can also allow more sectors to reopen on 4 July, as planned for Step 3. So, from 4 July, the following premises will be allowed to reopen provided they are COVID-Secure: hotels, bed and breakfasts and self-contained holiday accommodation caravan parks and campsites places of worship and libraries restaurants and cafes bars, pubs and social clubs cinemas and bingo halls museums and galleries hair salons and barbers outdoor playgrounds and outdoor gyms This has been an incredibly tough time for these establishments. But I hope that everyone working in them can take confidence in knowing they will be able to open their doors once again in just a couple of weeks’ time. And of course they should do so in a way that is COVID-Secure, keeping customers and staff safe. But I am afraid to say that some premises, such as nightclubs, swimming pools and indoor gyms, must remain closed for now given the particular risks of transmission in those settings. However, we are establishing taskforces for those sectors to establish how they too can open, in a COVID-Secure way, as fast as possible. At the same time, we can give people more freedom to see their friends and family. From 4 July, your household will be able to meet with one other household at a time, including staying over. This can be indoors or outside, at your home, in a restaurant or pub, or in paid accommodation. I want to stress you should remain socially distant from anyone outside your household. For meeting outdoors, you can continue to meet in a park or a garden in a group of up to six people, drawn from six different households. Again, at all times you should maintain social distancing from anyone outside your household. As we give people back more control over their lives, we will be asking them to follow guidance on limiting their social contact, rather than forcing them to do so through legislation. And this obviously requires everyone to act responsibly, which I have no doubt they will do. It will still be possible for the police to break up large and irresponsible gatherings. But neither the police themselves, or the public that they serve, want virtually every aspect of our behaviour to be subject to the criminal law. Yesterday the Deputy Chief Medical Officer and the Health Secretary set out updated advice for those who are shielding in England, so that they can soon start to return to leading more normal lives. Opening up more of Britain in this COVID-Secure way is only possible if everyone continues to stay alert to the risks of coronavirus. That means you should: stay 2 metres apart and if you can’t do that then keep 1 metre apart with mitigations wash your hands regularly wear face coverings on public transport, or where you are indoors in a crowded environment where distancing is not possible follow the rules when visiting businesses crucially, get a test done immediately if you develop symptoms and self-isolate if you are asked to by NHS Test and Trace We are only able to make these changes because we have persevered together and stuck to our path. We had five tests - and we met them. We had a plan - and we stuck to it. The government has asked a huge amount of all of you, and the people of this country have met that challenge with good humour and common sense. Of course, the fight is far from over. This is a nasty virus still that wants to take advantage of our carelessness. I’m afraid there will be local outbreaks. And I must tell you that if the virus were to begin to run out of control, I will not hesitate to put on the handbrake on and reverse some of these changes, at a local or indeed national level as required. But we can avoid that if we all continue to stay alert and do our bit to control the virus. The British public have proved again and again, not that it was ever in doubt it, that they can be trusted to do the right thing and to do it with common sense. There is no doubt we are beating back this virus and, with your continued cooperation and good judgment we will beat it once and for all. I’ll now hand over to Patrick."
"Boris Johnson","“The privilege of public service” given as the Ditchley Annual Lecture","27 June 2020","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/the-privilege-of-public-service-given-as-the-ditchley-annual-lecture","Writing in his Prison Notebooks, ninety years ago, the Italian Marxist thinker Antonio Gramsci defined our times. “The crisis consists precisely of the fact that the inherited is dying – and the new cannot be born; in this interregnum a great variety of morbid symptoms appear”. Gramsci’s analysis was developed between 1929 and 1935. The stability of the Edwardian Age – of secure crowns, borderless travel, imperial administrative elites and growing economic globalisation – was a memory. The inherited world of aristocratic liberalism had gone. But a new world of liberal, democratic nation states with welfare systems, social insurance and cross-class solidarity was still a distant prospect. And for those who were charged with leadership there were any number of morbid symptoms affecting their bodies politic at that time. Economic depression had undermined faith in Western democracy. Traditional political and party structures broke down while protectionist trade barriers went up. Ideological polarisation divided families and societies, competition for resources generated international conflicts, and new technologies offered expanded realms of opportunity but they also unsettled traditional patterns of working, and they threatened new and horrific means of destruction. Now our age is not the 1930s. But it is an age of morbid symptoms. The model that the current generation of political leaders inherited has been crumbling. For much of the period since 1945, Western nations have had relatively stable party and political structures. The leaders of those nations, political and business, have justified their positions on the grounds of meritocracy – we’ve proved through our exertions that we’re the best – and also on grounds of efficiency – we’ve shown through the spread of economic growth and greater opportunity that we deliver. But since the financial crisis of 2008 those foundations and assumptions have been systematically eroded. Across Western Europe we’ve seen the political system that we inherited fracture. Traditional Social Democratic parties have either been eclipsed or undermined to their left. Syriza in Greece overtook Pasok, Podemos in Spain took huge chunks out of the PSOE, the Dutch Labour Party lost three quarters of its vote in the last general election dropping from the 2nd to the 7th largest grouping in parliament. The French Socialists were left for dust by the radical leftists of La France Insoumise and the German Social Democrats struggle now to appeal to more than a sixth of their electorate, with a number of their former followers supporting the hard left Die Linke leading them to be consistently outpolled by the Greens. Traditional Christian Democrat or Conservative Parties have tended to fare better. But parties of the radical or populist right have, in many cases, again either undermined their previous dominance or overtaken them entirely. Vox in Spain has chipped away at the PP. The AfD is the first party to the right of the CDU and CSU to sit in the Bundestag since the Federal Republic was established. In the Netherlands the parties of Geert Wilders and Thierry Baudet, difficult to pigeonhole, but both certainly to the right of the traditional Dutch consensus, together have the support of almost twice as many voters as the Dutch Christian Democrats. In France, Marine Le Pen, and in Italy, Matteo Salvini, are the principal opposition figures – again, neither traditional Gaullists or Christian Democrats. And even in countries where the traditional party structures appear to be continuous with the world we inherited, the parties now take positions which would have been unfamiliar, to put it mildly, to their leaders much less than a generation ago. In America, the ruling Republican orthodoxy is to be sceptical of free trade; unattracted by notions of conventional global leadership; unconvinced by the efficacy of alliances such as NATO. All those positions are departures, I’m sure most would agree, from the position of George W. Bush never mind George H.W. Bush. It would take more time than I have available today, indeed perhaps more time than any of us still have to spend in our working lives, to establish definitively why this has been so. But, at its root, is – I think – a deep sense of disenchantment on the part of many of our citizens with a political system that they feel has failed them. The compact leaders offered – trust that we are the best, trust that we have your best interests at heart, and trust that we will deliver – was broken in their eyes. Even before the financial crisis of 2008, economic growth was slowing across the West, as identified by economists from Robert J. Gordon to Fredrik Erixon and Björn Weigel. And just as growth was slowing, so its diminishing benefits were becoming increasingly concentrated in the hands of the already fortunate – as Andy Haldane put it in 2016, the economic pie has not risen rapidly, and the pie has been unevenly sliced. Those with higher level cognitive skills saw an increasing return for their labour, while those working in traditional manufacturing saw more of their jobs undertaken abroad and indeed saw wages undercut at home. Globalisation, as practised, seemed to be eroding social solidarity and deepening a gulf between elites and those whom they governed or employed. And that gulf was not simply one of wealth. It was also one of sympathy. As the British author David Goodhart analysed in his book, The Road to Somewhere, the gap between those with connections and credentials who can live and work anywhere, and those with fewer resources who remain rooted to the heartland, has only widened in recent years. His work, preceded by Christopher Lasch, has been supplemented by the writings of Paul Collier and J.D. Vance among others, and they all underline that those in the elite with cognitive skills, qualifications and professional mobility tend to have, or develop, different social and political values from other citizens. The views, tastes and concerns of those who write for the New York Times, who run higher education institutions, chair business representative organisations, who advise on ESG responsibilities for corporates and indeed those who run Government departments tend to have become more distant over time from those who build homes, manufacture automobiles, work in logistics, harvest food and dispose of waste. To colour it crudely: the former are more sensitive to the harm caused by alleged micro-aggressions; the latter are less likely to be squeamish about tougher sentences for those guilty of actual physical aggression. This sense that those who had been in power had presided over a growing gulf in both wealth and attitudes, and were no longer working in solidarity with other citizens, was the backdrop for the crises in authority which started during the first decade of this century. Wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, both of which I supported I should add, were widely seen to have been mismanaged – one suffering from endless revision and ending in retreat; the other perceived to be launched in haste and error; and both revealed faults in policy-making and execution. Crises of authority in the church consequent upon abuse revelations, in Parliament following the expenses scandal and in the UK media after phone-tapping allegations all unsettled faith in existing leadership. The migrant crisis on Europe’s southern shores raised profound issues about just how humane and civilised our elites were. And all these discontents were rising as the world faced the terrible fallout from the financial crisis. Those in politics and business who had been trusted to generate increasing prosperity and provide for social security were found more than wanting. For many, they had failed to anticipate the crisis, failed to identify or take responsibility for what had gone wrong, failed to ensure the burden of repair was fairly shared, failed to reform the institutions, especially the finance and business institutions at the heart of the crisis, and overall failed to recognise the scale of change society demanded. All these factors underlay the revolt against the elites which saw voters desert established parties, withdraw their support for the economic consensus which had underpinned globalisation for at least three decades and, in many cases, opt for polarised identity politics rather than stay with broad-based national political movements. These morbid symptoms weakened our politics before the terrible global impact of the coronavirus and they have shaped how many have seen the response to that crisis. During the epidemic we have been made more powerfully aware of entrenched inequalities across the globe, seen how fragile the networks of our interconnected world have become and been reminded that confidence in projections about the future trajectory of a complex phenomenon is often undone. And the Covid epidemic has also, tragically, underlined the racial and ethnic inequalities in many societies, not least our own in the United Kingdom. The disproportionate impact of the virus on BAME communities is both heartbreaking and a reproach. The reasons for this particular tragedy are various and they require further, rigorous, investigation. But there can be no doubt that they reflect structural inequality in our society which has to be addressed. As we seek to restore our fractured economies and heal our divided societies following the advent of this pandemic, we must also be aware of other, complex and unpredictable, challenges still to be overcome. Science and technology, invaluable tools in tackling this pandemic, will bring other, dramatic, benefits to our world in the near future. Big data, machine learning, artificial intelligence, robotics and further automation, 3D printing, quantum computing and other advances will transform the manufacturing and service economy. Genetic sequencing and screening, gene editing and other life science and biotech advances could enable transformations in healthcare and environmental stewardship. All these developments have the potential to improve lives and livelihoods across the globe. But they also require us to think carefully about the moral questions they can raise. We have seen all too recently how progress, enabled by technology, has brought gains but also exposed flaws in how we organise our societies. The development of our global financial systems enabled capital to be more efficiently allocated, risk to be more effectively hedged and innovation to be more powerfully incentivised – but these financial systems also created the conditions for hugely profound economic dislocation. So, as we contemplate new technological and scientific breakthroughs we must also consider the ethical and political challenges they bring. Unless they are thoughtfully addressed, we risk further worsening the morbid symptoms of our times. The changes to the workplace the Fourth Industrial Revolution is likely to bring will see many current jobs and occupations either disappear or alter dramatically. The division between the fortunate and the forgotten could deepen perilously. Life science and biotech breakthroughs raise old questions about equitable access to healthcare in new, potentially very uncomfortable, ways and they open new territory for ethical concerns about our relationship with the natural world of which we are indivisibly part. And in speaking of the natural world, the growing loss of biodiversity and the threat of climate change also reinforce how existing inequalities and vulnerabilities risk becoming more pronounced and how we need to understand that complex, adaptive systems demand respectful attention, not glib assertions of mastery. And what makes these concerns pressing is the knowledge that all these changes – to technology, industry, employment, healthcare, food production, biodiversity and the climate – are coming at us fast. If we are to be equal to all these challenges, then – as the Prime Minister knows and feels passionately – we need to both acknowledge the scale of the change and be ready to change ourselves. Those in political leadership most of all. And just as the challenges of the Thirties inspired change, both good and bad, in the nature of political leadership – in the shape and scope of Government, in our sense of duty to the poorer, the vulnerable and the excluded, in our use of technology, in our sense of national and social solidarity – so we must ensure we follow a similar, constructive, progressive, inclusive path to that the best men and women chose then. And for me, no one walked that path better, in what W.H Auden called the low, dishonest, decade that was the Thirties, than Franklin Delano Roosevelt. When he assumed office in 1933, faith in free markets and the capitalist economy was ebbing dramatically. Indeed confidence in democracy itself was fragile – with, even in America, the idea of dictatorial executive authority winning surprising support. FDR managed to save capitalism, restore faith in democracy, indeed extend its dominion, renovate the reputation of Government, he set his country on a course of increasing prosperity and equality of opportunity for decades – and enabled America to emerge from a decade of peril with the system, and society, that the free citizens of the rest of the world most envied. He succeeded on such a scale, of course, because he was a remarkable leader. But there were principles underlining his approach which I think we should learn from now, as we seek to overcome our own crises of authority; as we seek to reform capitalism, re-invigorate support for democracy, and get Government working better for all while building more inclusive societies. First, Roosevelt took it as a given that no society could succeed unless every citizen within it had the chance to succeed. Throughout his political career he had been concerned by the plight of the poor and the vulnerable, and he knew they needed Government on their side if they were to achieve the dignity, status and independence they aspired to. Reform was needed, he argued, ‘that builds from the bottom up and not from the top down, that puts faith once more in the forgotten man at the bottom of the economic pyramid’. There are too many in our time and our society whose economic interests, and whose values, have been forgotten. In our unequal times we must attend increasingly to those who have suffered from neglect and condescension and also to those whose lives have been scarred by racism and prejudice. Our contemporary work of reform must put them first. Second, Roosevelt recognised that faced with a crisis that had shaken faith in Government, it was not simply a change of personnel and rhetoric that was required but a change in structure, ambition and organisation. The establishment of new bodies such as the Federal Emergency Relief Administration, the Public Works Association, the Civilian Conservation Corps and the Agricultural Adjustment Administration demonstrated a willingness to break the mould of the past. Of course, not every initiative upon which Roosevelt embarked was successful – but he recognised even before he became President that no one can predict at the start of a policy what its end will be. What is needed is both ambition in scope and honesty in assessment. Faced with tumultuous and difficult times, Roosevelt knew government had to be flexible, adaptive and empirical. That meant taking risks, but it also meant the humility to know when to change course – as he argued in 1932, ‘The country needs, and unless I mistake its temper, the country demands bold persistent experimentation. It is common sense to take a method and try it. If it fails, admit it frankly and try another’. And third, Roosevelt empowered reformers. Harold Ickes, Henry Wallace, Harry Hopkins, Frances Perkins, Louis Brandeis, Hugh Johnson and others were drawn from different traditions, backgrounds and disciplines – and they were set missions. Their role was not to administer the existing machine, or proclaim abstract virtues, but to act – to achieve real and concrete change in the lives of others. And as we contemplate the scale of the challenges ahead, for this country, and the wider democratic world, the lessons of FDR’s success have much to teach us. This Government in the UK was elected on the basis that it would be different from its predecessors, as the Prime Minister set out so brilliantly during the election campaign – and events have only made that mission of change more urgent. We have set out plans for reform in technical education, schools, on the environment, in international development, on housing and planning, in science, digital infrastructure, taxation, public procurement, transport and across the field of Government. But if this Government is to reform so much, it must also reform itself. As FDR recognised, the structures, ambitions and priorities of the Government machine need to change if real reform is to be implemented and to endure. It is part of my job in the Cabinet Office to help drive change. To help demonstrate the good that Government can do, to reaffirm the nobility of service to the public, and to strive every day to use the money, and the powers, that people have vested in us to improve their lives. Public service is a privilege. Not because it brings wealth or ease. Many of those who work alongside me in the civil service could command higher salaries, and indeed face less stress, in other fields. No, the privilege comes from knowing that those of us in Government have the chance every day to make a difference. The greatest gift that any of us can be given is the opportunity to lead lives of purpose in public service – to know that by our efforts others stand taller. But with that privilege comes a duty. To ask ourselves if what we are doing is genuinely transformative. Can we prove that we have made a difference? Can we demonstrate the effectiveness of what we have done with other people’s money? Can we prove that the regulations and agencies we have established have made clear, demonstrable, measurable, improvements to the lives of others? And can we prove that in a way that our fellow citizens can recognise and appreciate? I ask, because I am conscious, in line with the starting imperative of FDR’s reform mission, just how distant, in so many senses, Government is from the people. It is not just that all major Government departments are based in London, with the impact that concentration of senior jobs has on our economy. It is also the case that Westminster and Whitehall can become a looking-glass world. Government departments recruit in their own image, are influenced by the think tanks and lobbyists who breathe the same London air and are socially rooted in assumptions which are inescapably metropolitan. There is a tendency, and I am certainly not immune to it, to see success in Government measured by the sound of applause in the village, not the weight we lift from others’ distant shoulders. Favourable media commentary, pressure group plaudits, peer group approval, they all drive activity. But what is less often felt is the pressure to show, over time, that programmes have been effective and enduring. Of the 108 major programmes for which Government is responsible, only 8% are actually assessed to judge if they have been delivered effectively and have brought about the desired effects. Of course we politicians are principally to blame. We go for the sugar rush that comes from announcing radical initiatives, unveiling dramatic overhauls, launching new spending programmes, ramping up this and rolling out that. Done right, such moments can galvanise the system into action. But at times we risk the hunger for new policy announcements becoming insatiable. And there is also a tendency in Government to applaud the gracefully performative and overlook the boringly transformative. Inclusive lanyards, progressive hashtags and high-sounding declarations from champions of this-and-that good cause are often signals of noble intent, but they are no substitute for improving exam performance for children from under-performing ethnic minorities, enhancing the ability of prisons to rehabilitate prisoners or shifting our economic model to see higher returns to labour and fewer opportunities for rent-seeking. Tackling these challenges isn’t easy. Worthwhile things seldom are. But we can begin by changing important ways in which we work in Government. We can, literally, reduce the distance between Government and people by relocating Government decision-making centres to different parts of our United Kingdom. And in doing so we should be striving to reflect the full diversity of our United Kingdom. Why shouldn’t some of the policymakers intimately involved in reshaping our approach to energy and the decarbonisation of our economy be in Teesside, Humberside and Aberdeen? Shouldn’t those thinking about this sector be part of the communities whose jobs depend on getting these decisions right? And why are so many of those charged with developing our tax and welfare policies still based in London? Wouldn’t it be better for those deciding how taxpayers’ money is spent to be living and working alongside those citizens across the country, from Mansfield to Middlesbrough to Merthyr Tydfil, for whom every pound in tax is a significant inroad into their income? Should we not also be better at recruiting our policymakers from those overlooked and hitherto undervalued communities? There have been relocations of Government in the past but they have generally been to cities such as Bristol and Sheffield, with a particular socio-economic profile and a particularly large proportion of existing university graduates. We need to be more ambitious for Newcastle, for Teesside and Teesdale, for North Wales, for the North-East of Scotland, for East Lancashire, for West Bromwich. I also think we need to look at how we can develop an even more thoughtful approach to devolution, to urban leadership and to allowing communities to take back more control of the policies that matter to them. One of the glories of the United States is that there are fifty Governors, all of whom can be public policy innovators. As so often, diversity is strength. And an important part of bringing Government closer to people is making sure we have not just a wider spread of decision-making across the country but a broader and deeper pool of decision-makers. Groupthink can affect any organisation – the tendency to coalesce around a cosy consensus, to resist change, look for information to confirm existing biases and to reject rigorous testing of delivery. It is the opposite of the bold, restless experimentation FDR called for. And it is particularly likely to occur when people are drawn from similar backgrounds. Indeed, as the academic Jonathan Haidt has pointed out, when you get a critical mass of people in any organisation who have got similar outlooks, biases and preferences the minority who may dissent become progressively more uncomfortable about doing so. The more that fluent, intelligent, kind and sensitive people explain that the Emperor’s New Clothes are a thoughtful co-creation blending public and private sector expertise from the textile and non-textile communities, and these have been benchmarked against international norms and sensitive to both body positivity feedback and non-judgemental protocols concerning the tone-policing of issues around personal space, the less likely someone is to say the guy is naked. Which is why, as we strive to diversify the Government’s presence across the United Kingdom, we should also seek to diversify the talent pool from which we draw. How can we in Government be less southern, less middle class, less reliant on those with social science qualifications and more welcoming to those with physical science and mathematical qualifications – how can we be less anywhere and more somewhere – closer to the 52% who voted to Leave, and more understanding of why? Almost every arm of Government, and those with powerful voices within it, seemed estranged from the majority in 2016. That is not to say their views were not honest, principled and public-spirited. It is just to observe that a view, a perspective, a set of beliefs, which the majority, albeit slight, held in this country were rarely heard within Government. FDR asked his Government to remember the Forgotten Man. In the 2016 referendum those who had been too often forgotten asked to be remembered. And as well as valuing a diversity of views we should also, as I implied earlier, value a diversity of skills. The manner in which Government has rewarded its workers for many years now has, understandably, prized cognitive skills – the analytical, evaluative and, perhaps, above all, the presentational. I believe that should change. Delivery on the ground; making a difference in the community; practicable, measurable improvements in the lives of others should matter more. Public servants, including those who work for private sector organisations delivering public goods, such as those in the care sector, waste and refuse disposal, and the people who keep our hospitals hygienic and safe, should be at the centre of our policy-making. They are the people who have given so much in the recent crisis and represent the best in every community. Now of course we need to promote economic growth in everything we do. But the purpose of economic growth is to build a more civilised society. As the Prime Minister has consistently argued, we should be a pro-worker, pro-public servant People’s Government. The second Rooseveltian challenge is to change how Government itself works, to reorganise its institutions to become better at reform. The need for reform in so many areas is obvious. And this Government is determined to deliver it in a way that is consistent with our moral values. We know that we need to make opportunity more equal. We need to make productivity gains across our country more equitable. We need a just transition to a lower carbon world. We need to confront and stamp out racism wherever we find it. We need to heal and unite our country in the face of division and polarisation around identity. We need to make the twin virtues of earning and belonging work for others, and we need to ensure that solidarity across communities defeats the forces of division and dependence which dissolve the ties that bind. At the heart of our programme must be a focus on what works – what actually helps our fellow citizens to flourish. And that means, as I have emphasised, rigorous evaluation of Government programmes. What value do they add? What incentives do they provide for better performance and better service to others? The Treasury in the UK has been, historically, very good at questioning the cost of projects, but not their broader social value. Asking that question is not an evasion of Government responsibility but an embrace of it. And politicians like me must take responsibility for the effect of their actions and the consequences of their announcements. I helped set up National Citizen Service. It is a noble ideal. But by what criteria do we judge it a success? The numbers who have signed up, and the warmth they feel about the programme, are welcome. But what has society, measurably, achieved for that expenditure? I am proud to have played a part in setting up the Free Schools programme in England along with Lord Hill. But it is important to ask what, measurably and consistently, we have achieved over ten years through that investment. In the aftermath of the 2011 riots I pressed for a range of reforms. But however well-intentioned they all were we need to be honest and self-critical about their progress. Have the Gangs Taskforce and the use of Gang Injunctions made young people safer and helped young people out of the Criminal Justice System? One of the reforms of which I am proudest was the introduction of the Pupil Premium to support disadvantaged children with additional funding. I believe it has been transformative. But we need hard, testable, data on how it has worked. How well have we captured how effectively it is spent in the best schools and how are we setting about analysing what lessons to learn elsewhere? To answer these questions properly, indeed to use the answers to drive improvement in all public services, requires Government to change. First, Government needs to be rigorous and fearless in its evaluation of policy and projects. And in doing so, we need to ask not only questions about spending per se, but about effectiveness against ambition. It may well be legitimate to say that Government wants to spend a large amount to achieve an incremental improvement in a specific area for a vulnerable set of people – such as support for children in care. But the crucial question is what benefits have the extra spending and attention brought? That is not penny-pinching. It’s a real concern that the vulnerable benefit from this additional expenditure. What are the metrics against which improvement will be judged? How are appropriate tools such as randomised controlled trials being deployed to assess the difference being made? How do we guard against gaming and confirmation bias? All across Government at the moment that widespread rigour is missing. Which is just one of the reasons why the machinery needs to change. Government needs to evaluate data more rigorously and that means opening up data so others can judge the effectiveness of programmes as well. We need proper challenge from qualified outsiders. If Government ensures its departments and agencies share and publish data far more, then data analytics specialists can help us more rigorously to evaluate policy successes and delivery failures. People’s privacy of course must be protected. But once suitably anonymised, it is imperative that we learn the hugely valuable lessons that lie buried in our data. We also need to ask in those areas where our data is world class, as with the NHS, how we can use that to power scientific breakthroughs. Suitably anonymised, as I say, the deep and broad pool of health data we have can improve diagnostics and treatment, support life science innovation and close the health inequality gap. And, perhaps most importantly, Government must also ask itself if its people have the skills necessary for the challenges that I have set out. For many decades now we have neglected to ensure the Civil Service has all the basic skills required to serve Government, and our citizens, well. There are many brilliant people in our civil service, and I have never come across any civil servant who did not want to do his or her best for the country. But, nevertheless, there are a limited number, even in the Senior Civil Service, who have qualifications or expertise in mathematical, statistical and probability questions – and these are essential to public policy decisions. As governments in developed nations go, we in the UK are lagging behind many others in terms of numerical proficiency. But so many policy and implementation decisions depend on understanding mathematical reasoning. That means we need to reform not just recruitment, but training. We need to ensure more policy makers and decision makers feel comfortable discussing the Monte Carlo method or Bayesian statistics, more of those in Government are equipped to read a balance sheet and discuss what constitutes an appropriate return on investment, more are conversant with the commercial practices of those from whom we procure services and can negotiate the right contracts and enforce them appropriately. I should of course add that it is important that those of us who are politicians have the knowledge, skills, and indeed humility, to be able to ask the right questions and then seek to understand the answers. Reforming how Government works requires ministers who can reform themselves. And the need for appropriate skills, training and knowledge within Whitehall goes much further than the areas I have mentioned. Submissions, the papers which are prepared to guide ministerial decisions, and which were once the glory of our Civil Service, have become in far too many cases formulaic, over-long, jargon-heavy and back-covering. The ability to make a tight, evidence-rich, fact-based, argument which doesn’t waste words or evade hard choices is critical to effective Government. As is deep, domain-specific, knowledge. The Prime Minister has rightly argued that foreign policy-making is often weakened by the lack of deep knowledge of the language, culture and history of the nations with whom we are negotiating or whom we seek to influence. And as William Hague has pointed out, the decision to close the Foreign Office language school was an act of national self-harm and his restoration of it, along with his establishment of a new Diplomatic Academy, was a necessary renovation. That same determination to instil and to cultivate deep knowledge should apply across Government. Too much current Civil Service training is about vapid abstractions such as ‘Collaborating Better’ rather than about what works in classroom instruction or how to interrogate climate modelling or to find out what really goes on in the preparation of Crown Prosecution cases which leads to so many cracked trials. Of course, the vast majority of civil servants strive mightily to master the policy or delivery area that they are asked to cover. And I owe a personal debt to many great civil servants who have helped secure lasting change, who have warned me off foolish initiatives and who have demonstrated the very best in rigorous policy thinking. But there are systemic problems which mean that we often lose institutional memory and fail to build on hard-won success. With the exception of a few bodies such as the Education Endowment Foundation there are precious few Government-sponsored or owned sources of reliable evidence on what works. And the current structure of the Civil Service career ladder means that promotion comes from switching roles, and departments, with determined regularity. Just at the point that an official at the Department for International Trade who is a deputy director masters the intricacies of tariff schedules and their impact on important UK sectors and can recognise the opportunities that arise from liberalisation with Ruritania, he or she, if they want to progress in their career, then goes on to become a director in, say, the Department for Education overhauling child protection. Commentators, rightly, criticise the rapid turnover of ministers and the seemingly random reshuffle of Parliamentary Under-Secretaries for Paperclips after just a year to become Ministers of State for Paper Files. But far less noticed and just as, if not more, damaging, is the whirligig of Civil Service transfers and promotions. We must be able to promote those with proven expertise in their current role to perform the same, or similar, functions with greater status and higher rewards without them thinking they have to move away from the areas they know and love to rise in their profession. We would not ask an Orthopaedics Registrar to become a psychiatrist in order to make consultant. So why should we require an expert in agriculture negotiations with the EU to supervise the Universal Credit IT system in order to see their career progress? So, if we are to make the most of the amazing talent that we have in such abundance in the Civil Service, we need to both train better and incentivise more smartly. And we need to ensure that those in Government have access to teaching which develops deep knowledge. We know already from evidence of what works in education and the classroom that mastery of deep knowledge is the precondition of creativity and open-mindedness. Confident musical literacy, achieved after learning to read scores and to practise scales, allows them to move from laborious application to automatic performance, and mastering it allows the performer to become not just the passive reciter of others’ achievements but the author of original new work of quality and merit. Similarly, if those in Government have deep subject knowledge they move from reciters of the jargon generated by producer interests into the creators of original policy that serve the widest possible public interest. That is why we need to ensure that we have a proper, and properly-resourced campus for training those in Government. One which is not preoccupied with the latest coaching theology or sub-business school jargon but equips the many hugely talented people within the Civil Service to become as knowledgeable in their policy areas as consultant surgeons, chancery barristers and biochemistry professors are in theirs. And, more than that, we need to ensure that basic writing, meeting chairing and time management skills are de rigueur for all policy civil servants. The third Rooseveltian imperative I have invoked is the bias towards experimentation. And this is perhaps the hardest to achieve. There are so many barriers to doing things differently in Government, and so many incentives to play safe that it is difficult to know where to start. It is a cliché to say of Government that no-one ever lost their job for recommending the contract go to IBM. If you decide that you will procure services from a new organisation and, if things go wrong, you will face the wrath of the National Audit Office, the criticism of self-righteous chairs of parliamentary select committees, the hindsight-rich rancour of newspaper columnists as well as the disappointed froideur of your Permanent Secretary and Secretary of State. On the other hand, if you choose to have the service performed by an established supplier, choose to assess their performance by deferring to management consultants, set up a board to manage the process with officials from lots of different departments then you are insulated from failure. The delivery companies are too big to fail, too embedded in so much else that Government does, too sanctified by the faith other departments have already placed in them. The consultants are an invaluable prophylactic – if these super bright people from the private sector with MBA degrees and huge earnings outside said it was okay, well, it must have been. And the cross-Whitehall board is the biggest insurance policy of all. You can’t hold me accountable – it was a ‘shared’ decision. All of these factors work against innovation – and accountability. Innovation comes when people take reasonable risks – and also responsibility. We need to move to a system where those who propose the innovative, the different, the challenging, are given room to progress and, if necessary, fail. But we must then ensure that we learn quickly, adjust and respond. In my time in politics I have got many things wrong. But I have, most of the time, been blessed by the ability of Prime Ministers to forgive, provided I learned the lesson. That is why it is the responsibility of those in positions of political leadership – myself chief among them – to support those who try something different and defend them if, at first, it doesn’t work. And then to ensure we learn why and do better next time. My first attempt as Education Secretary at a new history curriculum was deeply flawed, but the challenge it provoked improved on everything that had gone before. My cancellation of the Brown government’s Building Schools for the Future programme was a political fiasco, but it led to a method of commissioning new school buildings that saved the taxpayer billions. My proposal to bring back O-Levels strained the bonds of the 2010-2015 coalition and it had to be abandoned but it led to a significant improvement in GCSE standards and school performance. I should add that those GCSE reforms only worked because of the leadership of two outstanding public servants – Dame Glenys Stacey and Amanda Spielman – who ran the exams watchdog Ofqual at the time. They stood firm in the face of orchestrated opposition from those who wanted standards lowered, and they helped end grade inflation. Exam reform was a rocky road but they made the experiment work. We need, as a Government, to create the space for the experimental and to acknowledge we won’t always achieve perfection on Day One. We will throw everything at increasing ventilator capacity, some projects will misfire, some will seem promising but fall at the final hurdle, but along the way we will end up with unexpected gains, and as we have seen in the past few months, a willingness to experiment will help drive up a huge increase in ventilator capacity. There is of course also a particular merit also in investing in the literal experimentation of pure science. As the success of DARPA in the US shows, sometimes by design, and sometimes by obliquity, hugely beneficial innovation can occur. Of course, some of the projects in which DARPA has invested have failed and foundered, but the knowledge that high ambition is supported and incentivised and wrong turnings accepted as necessary costs along the way has clearly brought huge benefits. Sadly far too often, innovation in Government is treated as though it were a mischief rather than a model. The default mechanism of the National Audit Office, Public Accounts Committee, other select committees and various commentators is that any departure from the status quo must be assumed to be more downside than upside. Had they been able to interrogate George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton in 1783 they would have concluded that American independence was an expensive, untried and unjustifiable innovation. In Treasury terms they would have said it was novel and contentious and therefore should be stopped. The whole culture of Government, and the wider world of political commentary, is hostile to risk, adventure, experimentation and novelty. But the experience of FDR and his administration was that it was only through big risks, and radical experiments, that progress could be assured. Many of the programmes initiated as part of the New Deal failed on their own terms. But, overall, the re-orientation of Government to help the Forgotten Man, to restore hope in place of fear, to change Government so it worked for all citizens and to be bold and restless in experimentation of new ways of working succeeded. That is why now, as is our intention as Government, we should reform planning rules to fast track beautiful development, we should pioneer biodiversity net gain to offset any adverse consequences of development, we should better use anonymised NHS data to improve healthcare delivery, we should allow parents and others to compare schools on value added, exam entries and attendance, among other factors, we should compare individual courts, judges and CPS managers on their efficacy on processing cases, we should look at how successful individual prisons are at delivering education and rehabilitation programmes, and we should compare that with re-offending rates, we should assess the effectiveness of anti-radicalisation programmes, we should ask what value for money gains the Troubled Families Programme has secured, we should interrogate the basis on which defence procurement contracts are considered value for money and by who, and we should ask how we judge the real impact of development spending, and I could go on… The heart of my case, as I hope everyone now appreciates, is simple. Faith in conventional political parties, their leadership and their allies in business has been broken. Failures of policy and judgment have put previously existing elites in the dock. Their misjudgements, in the eyes of many, have been compounded by cultural condescension and insulation from accountability. The concerns of our fellow citizens are real. They matter. Their analysis is resonant. To carry on rejecting it will only weaken our politics and strengthen division. We have faced similar, though not identical, crises, before. To face the crisis honestly, we must change. Confronted with a similar, though not identical, challenge in the 1930s FDR identified three critical needs: first, to make the Forgotten Man – i.e. the victim of crisis and inequality - our first concern; second, to transform Government to make it the efficient force for good the times command; and third, experiment and explore different routes in a crisis in order to escape with an emphasis on risk-taking. I defy anyone now to say that the scale of the challenges our governments face are lesser than those faced by FDR in 1933, or the scale of change required is smaller. If the suggestions for change I have put forward are wrong, or mistaken, which they may honestly be, I hope the response is to call for greater radicalism not less. We should always be receptive to bold new policy proposals. And now in Government we must listen to ideas on transforming how we deliver, such as those from GovernUp and the Commission for Smart Government which it will shortly launch, because we surely know the machinery of government is no longer equal to the challenges of today. We owe change to the people we serve. Every morning I wake up saddened by the fact we haven’t done more to make the most of every talent in our land, reproaching myself that we did not do more in children’s social care, primary schooling and secondary schooling to provide opportunities and keep young people safe. I worry that we have not succeeded in reforming the youth justice system, the police, the CPS and the courts. But we can do better, we can redeem souls, we can save lives through public sector reform. If money is rightly directed, properly authorised and its spending effectively evaluated then massive progress can be made. Let me end on a personal note. I am in public service, as an MP and Government Minister, because I want to tackle inequality. I have other passions – the environment, culture, sport. But my driving mission in politics is to make opportunity more equal. I want to ensure that whatever their background, every child has the chance to succeed, and nothing we do should hold them back. It is on that basis I make my case and on which I am happy to be judged."
"Boris Johnson","PM Economy Speech: 30 June 2020","30 June 2020","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-economy-speech-30-june-2020","It may seem a bit premature to make a speech now about Britain after Covid when that deceptively nasty disease is still rampant in other countries when global case numbers are growing fast and when many in this country are nervous – rightly – about more outbreaks whether national or local like the flare-up in Leicester whereas I promised we are putting on the brakes and I thank the people of Leicester for their forbearance and yet we cannot continue simply to be prisoners of this crisis We are preparing now slowly and cautiously to come out of hibernation and I believe it is absolutely vital for us now to set out the way ahead so that everyone can think and plan for the future – short, medium and long term because if the covid crisis has taught us one thing it is that this country needs to be ready for what may be coming and we need to be able to move with levels of energy and speed that we have not needed for generations And I know that there are plenty of things that people say and will say that we got wrong and we owe that discussion and that honesty to the tens of thousands who have died before their time to the families who have lost loved ones and of course there must be time to learn the lessons, and we will but I also know that some things went right – and emphatically right I think of the speed and efficiency with which we put up the Nightingales – ten days for a hospital – I think of the drive and inventiveness of the British companies who rose to the ventilator challenge with three brand new production lines called into being within the space of eight weeks with a new model of ventilator developed in March and granted regulatory approval in weeks, and 9,500 of them now made I pay tribute to the pace at which Oxford university managed to perform the trials for dexamethasone the world’s first demonstrably life-saving treatment for the disease I am in awe of the problem-crunching fury with which HMRC and the Treasury created the furlough scheme and all the other means of support world-leading standards of protection for jobs and incomes set up in a matter of days There were brilliant and determined individuals who more than rose to the challenge of this crisis there were thousands and thousands who put their hearts and souls into it and yet our debt is not just to them It is not just even to the devotion and love of the NHS and the care workers who saved so many lives including my own There was one big reason in the end that we were able to avert a far worse disaster and that was because the whole of society came together to make a sacrifice on behalf of those who might be particularly vulnerable – particularly the elderly We all knew went we went into lockdown that there would be huge economic costs We could see what would happen and yet we did it, we the United Kingdom in a display of solidarity not seen since world war two and so today we must combine that energy and drive with that concentrated burst of collective willpower that protected the NHS controlled the virus and saved literally hundreds of thousands of lives and we must work fast because we have already seen the vertiginous drop in GDP and we know that people are worried now about their jobs and their businesses and we are waiting as if between the flash of lightning and the thunderclap with our hearts in our mouths for the full economic reverberations to appear and we must use this moment – now – this interval to plan our response and to fix of course the problems that were most brutally illuminated in that covid lightning flash the problems in our social care system the parts of government that seemed to respond so sluggishly so that sometimes it seemed like that recurring bad dream when you are telling your feet to run and your feet won’t move and yet we must also go further and realise that if we are to recover fully if we are to deal with the coming economic aftershock then this covid crisis is also the moment to address the problems in our country that we have failed to tackle for decades because it is one of the most extraordinary features of the UK – in so many ways the greatest place on earth – that we tolerate such yawning gaps between the best and the rest We have some of the best and most productive companies in the world – and yet we are not as nationally productive as many of our global competitors We have the world’s most brilliant medical minds, the world’s best pharmaceutical companies, our doctors and treatments are the best in the world and yet we have so many millions who have to wait for too long to see their GP – even before the new waiting lists produced by the crisis We have umpteen fantastic, globally outstanding universities and yet too many degree courses are not now delivering value and for a century we have failed to invest enough in further education and give young people the practical training and further education they need We have a capital city that was, is and will be in so many ways the capital of the world theatre, finance, tech, restaurants you name it, London leads the world and yet too many parts of this country have felt left behind neglected, unloved, as though someone had taken a strategic decision that their fate did not matter as much as the metropolis so I want you to know that this government not only has a vision to change this country for the better we have a mission to unite and to level up the mission on which we were elected last year and we have a plan and in advancing that plan now I just serve notice that we will not be responding to this crisis with what people called austerity we are not going to try to cheese-pare our way out of trouble because the world has moved on since 2008 and we not only face a new and in some ways a far bigger challenge and I can tell everybody, businesses that next week the Chancellor will be setting out our immediate plan to support the economy through the first phase of our recovery but this moment also gives us a much greater chance to be radical and to do things differently to build back better to build back bolder and so we will be doubling down on our strategy we will double down on levelling up and when I say level up, I don’t mean attacking our great companies I don’t mean impeding the success of London – far from it or launching some punitive raid on the wealth creators I don’t believe in tearing people down any more than I believe in tearing down statues that are part of our heritage let alone a statue of our greatest wartime leader I believe in building people up giving everyone growing up in this country the opportunity they need whoever you are, whatever your ethnicity, whatever your background and there are certain things that are indispensable for that opportunity the hospital you are born in the schools you go to the safety of the streets where you grow up and this government has not forgotten that we were elected to build 40 new hospitals and we will – Matt Hancock is setting out the list in the next few days, and that is just the beginning We will continue and step up the biggest ever programme of funding the NHS and we won’t wait to fix the problem of social care that every government has flunked for the last 30 years We will end the injustice that some people have to sell their homes to finance the costs of their care while others don’t We are finalising our plans and we will build a cross-party consensus We will look after those who have looked after us and at the same time We will build the foundations now for future prosperity to make this country – a Britain that is fully independent and self-governing for the first time in 45 years the most attractive place to live and to invest and to set up a company with the most motivated and highly skilled workforce and so we are investing massively now in education with over £14bn for primary and secondary education between now and 2023 and today with a new ten year school building programme beginning now with £1bn for the first 50 schools and a vast £1.5 bn programme of refurbishing our dilapidated Further Education sector – dilapidated in many places, but not here of course because it is time the system recognised that talent and genius are expressed as much by hand and by eye as they are in a spreadsheet or an essay so when I say unite and level up when I say build up people and build up talent I want to end the current injustice that means a pupil from a London state school is now 50 per cent more likely to go to a top university than a pupil from the west midlands and that is not only unjust it is such a waste of human talent We will unleash the potential of the entire country and that means basic things, cracking down again on the crime that blights too many streets and too many lives and we will get on with our plan to recruit 20,000 more police officers – we have already found 3,000 and I thank them for everything they are doing and have done in this crisis and we will back our police all the way and give our justice system the powers we need to end the lunacy that stops us – for instance – deporting some violent offenders just as we have already stopped the automatic early release of terrorists We will make this country safer We will build the hospitals build the schools and the colleges but we will also build back greener and build a more beautiful Britain we will protect the landscape with flood defences and plant 30,000 hectares of trees every year creating a new patchwork of woodlands to enchant and re-energise the soul and in those towns that feel left behind we have plans to invest in their centres and with new academy schools, new green buses, new broadband and we want to make them places where people have the confidence to stay, to raise their families and to start businesses and not to feel that the action is all in the cities or the metropolis and yet I don’t think that this crisis has ended the desire or need to move around swiftly and efficiently We have learned the wonders of Zoom and MS Teams the joys of muting or unmuting our colleagues at key moments but we still need to travel and more than ever the time has come when we must unite and level up in the most basic way possible not just with HS2 and NPR but with better roads, better rail unblocking the central Manchester bottleneck that delays services across the north and 4000 brand new zero carbon buses and a massive new plan for cycleways and we will build and rebuild those vital connexions to every part of the UK because now is the moment to strengthen that incredible partnership between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and I know that some have sometimes played up the legitimate variations in the response between the devolved administrations but when you look at the whole effort you can see the absolutely vital role of that union and that partnership It is our fantastic UK armed services that have played such a crucial role in this crisis running the test centres, building the hospitals, transporting people from the Shetlands to the right Covid wards It was the might of the UK Treasury that set up that furlough scheme – in all corners of the country and sent massive and immediate extra funding to all four parts of the UK I believe the union has more than showed its worth and a prosperous and united Kingdom must be a connected Kingdom and that is why we are now accelerating projects from South West to the North East from Wales, to Scotland, to Northern Ireland and to drive economic growth in all parts of the country we will carry out a study of all future road, rail, air and cross-sea links between our all our four parts of the UK When did a government first promise to dual the A1 to Scotland ? It was 1992 Well this government is going to do it and it is this infrastructure revolution that will allow us to end that other chronic failure of the British state decade after decade in which we have failed to build enough homes We will build fantastic new homes on brownfield sites and other areas that with better transport and other infrastructure could frankly be suitable and right for development and address that intergenerational injustice and help young people get on the housing ladder in the way that their parents and grandparents could and it is to galvanise this whole process that this government will shortly bring forward the most radical reforms of our planning system since the end of the second world war Yes, we will insist on beautiful and low carbon homes but covid has taught us the cost of delay why does UK public procurement take 50 per cent longer than in Germany? why are UK capital costs typically between 10 and 30 per cent higher than other European projects? Why is HS2 – transformational though it will be – going to cost us the equivalent of the GDP of Sri Lanka? Why are we so slow at building homes by comparison with other European countries? In 2018 we built 2.25 homes per 1000 people Germany managed 3.6, the Netherlands 3.8, France 6.8 I tell you why - because time is money, and the newt-counting delays in our system are a massive drag on the productivity and the prosperity of this country and so we will build better and build greener but we will also build faster and that is why the Chancellor and I have set up Project Speed to scythe through red tape and get things done and with every home we make, every mile of full fibre broadband that we lay with every flood-defending culvert that we dig with every railway station, hospital or school that we build we will of course be tackling the next wave of this crisis by helping to create thousands of high-paid high-skilled jobs because we know in our hearts that the furloughing cannot go on forever and as the economy recovers we also know that the jobs that many people had in January are also not coming back or at least not in that form and we know that is our biggest and most immediate economic challenge that we face and so we will offer an Opportunity Guarantee so that every young person has the chance of apprenticeship or an in-work placement so that they maintain the skills and confidence they need to find the job that is right for them I am conscious as I say all this that it sounds like a prodigious amount of government intervention It sounds like a New Deal and all I can say is that if so, then that is how it is meant to sound and to be because that is what the times demand a government that is powerful and determined and that puts its arms around people at a time of crisis that tackles homelessness the inequalities that drive people to food banks because it is time now not just for a New Deal but a Fair Deal for the British people and we can do all this now partly because of the prudent management of the economy in the last ten years but also because we are planning to invest now when the cost of borrowing allows it and when the returns are greatest because that is the way both now and in the medium term to drive the growth, to fuel the animal spirits and the long-term business investment on which our future prosperity depends my friends I am not a communist I believe it is also the job of government to create the conditions for free market enterprise and yes of course we clap for our NHS but under this government we also applaud those who make our NHS possible our innovators our wealth creators our capitalists and financiers because in the end it is their willingness to take risks with their own money that will be crucial for our future success This is Dudley the birthplace of Abraham Darby who massively accelerated the industrial revolution by using coke instead of charcoal to produce pig iron (it may not sound like it, but it’s also the greener option) and today Dudley remains at the cutting edge of green technology that is increasingly driving the whole of the UK economy It was here in 2011 that a company called Westfield produced the world’s first commercially viable electric racing car and the whole of the West Midlands is now a global centre of battery technology and batteries for EVs and that is the vision of Mayor Andy Street, and we will back that vision This is a government that backs Britain, and believes in British innovation and this summer we will be creating a new science funding agency to back high risk, high reward projects because in the next 100 years the most successful societies will be the most innovative societies and we in this country have the knack of innovation we lead the world in quantum computing, in life sciences, in genomics, in AI, space satellites, net zero planes, and in the long term solutions to global warming wind, solar, hydrogen technology carbon capture and storage, nuclear and as part of our mission to reach Net Zero CO2 emissions by 2050, we should set ourselves the goal now of producing the world’s first zero emission long haul passenger plane Jet Zero, let’s do it and though we are no longer a military superpower we can be a science superpower but we must end the chasm between invention and application that means a brilliant British discovery disappears to California and becomes a billion dollar American company or a Chinese company and we need now a new dynamic commercial spirit to make the most of UK breakthroughs so that British ideas produce new British industries and British jobs And yet to achieve all that from where we are now we must get on first with the hard and painstaking work of re-opening our economy and I feel the urgency and impatience of all those sectors that are still being held back the theatres, the arts, the salons, the gyms, the cricket clubs, sectors in which we lead the world and yet which suffer because they depend on the very physical proximity and contact that Covid makes so difficult and I say to everybody in those sectors we will get you going as fast as we can we will get life back to normal for as many as possible as fast as possible But as we approach July 4 I am afraid that the dangers – as we can see in Leicester - have not gone away the virus is out there still circling like a shark in the water and it will take all our collective discipline and resolve to keep that virus at bay and if we can and get on to the next phase of recovery then we can get on all the faster to the next phase and to the delivery of our plan This is a government that is wholly committed not just to defeating coronavirus but to using this crisis finally to tackle this country’s great unresolved challenges of the last three decades to build the homes to fix the NHS to solve social care to tackle the skills crisis to mend the indefensible gap in opportunity and productivity and connectivity between the regions of the UK to unite and level up and to that end we will build, build, build build back better build back greener build back faster and to do that at the pace that this moment requires we need now to distil the very best of the psychic energy of the last few months let’s take the zap and élan of the armed services who helped to build the Nightingales let’s take the selflessness and the love of the health and the care workers and the charities the public spirit and the good humour of the entire population and let’s brew them together with the superhuman energy of Captain Tom bounding around his garden at the age of 100 and raising millions for charity let’s take that combination, that spirit bottle it, swig it and I believe we will have found if not quite a magic potion, at least the right formula to get us through these dark times And I must stress that there will still be some tough times ahead and to work this whole plan through will take effort, and nerve, and patience and no we won’t get everything right we certainly won’t get everything right first time but this is the moment to be ambitious to believe in Britain to rise to the scale of the challenge and the opportunity If we deliver this plan together then we will together build our way back to health We will not just bounce back We will bounce forward – stronger and better and more united than ever before. Thank you all very much."
"Boris Johnson","As Israel's friend, I urge you not to annex: PM Boris Johnson","1 July 2020","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/as-israels-friend-i-urge-you-not-to-annex-pm-boris-johnson","My first real experience of Israel came when I was 18, and spent several weeks working in the kitchens at kibbutz Kfar HaNassi. My fellow kibbutzniks managed to survive my contribution to their diet. I took away a profound attachment to the state of Israel. My many visits in recent years have left a deep impression – whether the solemnity and dignity of Yad Vashem, memorial to a unique crime in world history; the extraordinary gathering of world leaders for the funeral of an old friend, Shimon Peres; or cycling down Rothschild Boulevard with the Mayor of Tel Aviv, marvelling at the vibrancy of the White City. I am a passionate defender of Israel. Few causes are closer to my heart than ensuring its people are protected from the menace of terrorism and anti-Semitic incitement. The UK has always stood by Israel and its right to live as any nation should be able to, in peace and security. Our commitment to Israel’s security will be unshakeable while I am Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. So it is with sadness that I have followed the proposals to annex Palestinian territory. As a life-long friend, admirer and supporter of Israel, I am fearful that these proposals will fail in their objective of securing Israel’s borders and will be contrary to Israel’s own long-term interests. Annexation would put in jeopardy the progress that Israel has made in improving relationships with the Arab and Muslim world. I have never been more convinced that Israel’s interests overlap with those of our closest partners in the Arab world, including potential security cooperation against shared threats. But however strong their interest in a different kind of relationship with Israel, annexation would inevitably set back these opportunities and constrain potential Arab partners. Israel’s enemies would seize upon it, and use it against those in the Middle East who want to see progress. I want to see an outcome that delivers justice for both Israelis and Palestinians. The UK has often stood in a small minority at the UN in defending Israel against unwarranted and wholly disproportionate criticism. Annexation would represent a violation of international law. It would also be a gift to those who want to perpetuate the old stories about Israel. I profoundly hope that annexation does not go ahead. If it does, the UK will not recognise any changes to the 1967 lines, except those agreed between both parties. There is another way. Like many Israelis, I am frustrated that peace talks have ended in failure. While I understand the frustration felt by both sides, we must now use the energy of this moment to once more come back to the table and strive to hammer out a solution. This will require compromise on all sides. I do not underestimate the challenges in achieving lasting peace. So many efforts have been made. So many have paid the ultimate price, including of course Yitzhak Rabin. But I still believe the only way to achieve true, lasting security for Israel, the homeland for the Jewish people, is through a solution that allows justice and security for both Israelis and Palestinians. I refuse to believe that this is impossible. I welcome the commitment that President Trump has made to find a way forward. We will work tirelessly with the US - and other partners in the Arab world and Europe - to try to make peace a reality. I am immensely proud of the UK’s contribution to the birth of Israel with the 1917 Balfour Declaration. But it will remain unfinished business until there is a solution which provides justice and lasting peace for both Israelis and Palestinians. The only way it can be achieved is for both sides to return to the negotiating table. That must be our goal. Annexation would only take us further away from it."
"Boris Johnson","Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 3 July 2020","3 July 2020","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-3-july-2020","Good evening, Since I last spoke to you from this podium, we have continued to make progress nationally against the virus. We are now reporting regularly fewer than 1,000 new cases each day. The Office for National Statistics estimates that between 14 June and 27 June, the most recent period they have analysed, 25,000 people in the community in England had the virus – 1 person in every 2,200. SAGE assess that the R rate – the average number of people each infected person passes the virus onto – remains between 0.7 and 0.9 across the UK. SAGE also assess that, in England, the number of new infections is shrinking by between 2 and 5% every day. And while the number of people dying with coronavirus remains too high, the numbers do continue to fall. Now of course this picture is not universal. There are areas – such as Leicester – where the virus is still more prevalent than we would like. We always said there would be local outbreaks requiring local action. This is to be expected and will, I’m afraid, be a feature of our lives for some time to come. But that should not take away from the great progress we have made, together, as a country against this vicious disease. This progress is the reason why we have been able – slowly, carefully, cautiously – to ease the national lockdown. Without doubt, lockdown has saved many hundreds of thousands of lives – but it has also had a devastating impact on our way of life and our economy. And of course, lockdown has not yet been lifted entirely. Indoor gyms, nail bars and swimming pools are still closed, mass gatherings are still prohibited, social distancing is still essential. I want these restrictions to be lifted as soon as possible – of course I do. We have established taskforces to work rapidly and closely with the sectors that remain closed to explore how they can be Covid Secure. I am pleased to report good progress is being made. Next week we will set out a timetable for their re-opening – though of course I can only lift those remaining, national restrictions as and when it is safe to do so. Our goal remains to enable as many people as possible to live their lives as close to normally as possible – in a way which is as fair and as safe as possible. To achieve this we need to move away from blanket, national measures, to targeted, local measures. So instead of locking down the whole country, we will lock down specific premises or local areas where the virus is spreading. Instead of closing down non-essential retail and hospitality nationwide, we will only shut establishments locally as required. Instead of shutting all schools for most pupils, from September we will only shut those schools where it is absolutely necessary to control an outbreak. And instead of quarantining arrivals from the whole world, we will only quarantine arrivals from those countries where the virus is, sadly, not yet under control. We are already implementing this targeted approach in England. In Weston-Super-Mare, we identified an outbreak in a hospital, closed it to visitors and new admissions, tested all staff and patients and gave the hospital a deep clean. The outbreak was contained and the hospital is open again. In Kirklees, we identified an outbreak at a meat packing plant, shut down the plant, moved in a mobile testing unit, tested all employees and traced the contacts of those who were positive. The outbreak was contained and the plant has reopened with additional safety measures in place. And of course more recently in Leicester, we identified a community-wide outbreak which was not restricted to a single location, unlike Weston-Super-Mare and Kirklees. Public Health England engaged with the local authority, mobile testing units were deployed, full data was shared – council-wide data was shared on 11 June, and postcode-level data was shared last week. This enhanced monitoring through additional testing showed that the infection rate in Leicester was three times the next highest infection rate in any other city in the country. So on Monday, the Health Secretary announced local lockdown measures in Leicester for an initial period of 2 weeks. In each of these cases, the problems identified were specific to Weston-Super-Mare, Kirklees and Leicester. So of course it made sense to take action locally, rather than re-impose restrictions on the whole country. And we are learning the whole time. With each local outbreak, we see what works well and what not so well, so that we do better next time. Informed by our experience of these cases, we have developed an approach for controlling future local outbreaks which has five principle components: monitoring, engagement, testing, targeted restrictions and finally, as a last resort, lockdown. First, monitoring. Public Health England, working with the Joint Biosecurity Centre, will examine carefully data on the spread of the disease and people’s behaviour across the country. They will look out for emerging trends, rising case numbers and other indicators, while taking into account local factors. Critically, we have made local data available to all Directors of Public Health in local authorities, so they too can monitor what is happening in their area. And local data will also be available to the public on the gov.uk dashboard. Second, engagement. If monitoring identifies local problems, NHS Test and Trace and PHE will work with the relevant local authority to develop a deeper understanding of the problem and identify solutions. Working with local agencies, we will seek to keep the local community informed at every stage, so they know what is happening and what actions, if any, they need to take. Third, testing. We now have substantial testing capacity nationwide and we have the ability to target that capacity at local areas in order to get a grip on emerging outbreaks. Scaled-up testing at a local level, combined with contract tracing through NHS Test and Trace, can control the virus and thus avoid more stringent measures. Fourth, targeted restrictions. If the virus continues to spread, we will restrict activities at particular locations and close individual premises. As in Weston-Super-Mare and Kirklees, we will restrict access to places which become hotspots for the virus, while testing people who have spent time in those places, and tracing the contacts of anyone who tests positive. Fifth, local lockdown. If the previous measures have not proven to be enough, we will introduce local lockdowns extending across whole communities. As in Leicester, that could mean shutting businesses venues that would otherwise be open, closing schools or urging people once more to stay at home. Local lockdowns will be carefully calibrated depending on the scientific and specific circumstances of each outbreak and we are continually exploring smarter means of containing the virus. So that is the approach we will take as local outbreaks occur and we will set out more detail soon. Let me end by looking forward to this weekend. Tomorrow, there will be a moment of remembrance for those whose lives have tragically been lost before their time. And at 5pm on Sunday, the NHS’s 72nd birthday, we can all come together to clap those who have worked tirelessly and selflessly to help the nation get through this pandemic. I know everyone will be looking forward to the relaxation of national restrictions. As lockdown eases, we should focus on supporting the livelihoods of business owners and their employees up and down the country – all of whom are opening their doors for the first time in more than three months. They are our local restaurants, hairdressers, libraries, museums, cinemas, and yes, pubs. They are also hotels, B&Bs, indeed much of our tourism industry. All these businesses and their workers have put in a heroic effort to prepare their venues for this reopening, to work out a way to trade in a way that keeps their customers safe. But the success of these businesses, the livelihoods of those who rely on them, and ultimately the economic health of the whole country is dependent on every single one of us acting responsibly. We must not let them down. Lockdown only succeeded in controlling the virus because everyone worked together, and we will only succeed in reopening if everyone works together again. Because we are not out of the woods yet. The virus is still with us and the spike in Leicester has shown that. If it starts running out of control again this Government will not hesitate in putting on the brakes and re-imposing restrictions. Anyone who flouts social distancing and COVID-Secure rules is not only putting us all at risk but letting down those businesses and workers who have done so much to prepare for this new normal. So as we take this next step, our biggest step yet, on the road to recovery, I urge the British people to do so safely. Remember – don’t gather in groups of more than 6 outside or 2 households in any setting. Keep your distance from those outside your household – 2 metres if you can, 1 metre with precautions if you can’t. Wash your hands. Let’s all stay alert, control the virus, save lives – and enjoy summer safely."
"Boris Johnson","Resilience in light of COVID: Climate Action on the Road to COP26","3 July 2020","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/resilience-in-light-of-covid-climate-action-on-the-road-to-cop26","Ladies and gentlemen. In recent weeks, we have seen unprecedented heatwaves in Siberia, with areas which usually see temperatures of zero degrees Celsius reaching 25 degrees. Across East Africa flash floods have displaced hundreds of thousands of people. Over 150,000 acres have been destroyed in Arizona wildfires. There have been earthquakes in Mexico, floods in central China and a tornado in India. This has the most profound impact on people on the frontline of climate change. Those who have contributed the least and have the fewest resources to adapt. The first, and last, international travel I did as COP26 President, before the world went into lockdown, was a visit to the United Nations in New York. I had an opportunity to talk to a whole range of colleagues. I spoke particularly to the permanent representatives of the Small Island Developing States and Least Developed Countries. It was a really powerful and timely reminder of the urgency we need in tackling the threat of climate change. As the representative of one of the Small Island Developing States said to me: “Tackling climate change is an existential issue for us. If we do not get it right, we will no longer have a place to call home.” So ladies and gentlemen, the small island nation states do not have the luxury of time. We collectively, do not have the luxury of time. And that is why we must act now. That is why it is so vital that we are coming together today, to speak at this event. I’d like to thank the organisers, E3G and the International Institute for Environment and Development for bringing us together. As we look forward to COP26 next November, our aim is to ramp up ambition towards a climate-resilient, zero-carbon economy. We want all countries to submit more ambitious Nationally Determined Contributions, driving further cuts in carbon emissions by 2030. And we want all nations committing to reaching net zero emissions as soon as possible. Ahead of the summit, we have defined five areas which need particular attention to help us achieve our goals. Clean energy, clean transport, nature-based solutions, finance, and the issue we are here to talk about, adaptation and resilience. We must help people, economies and the environment to adapt and prepare for the impacts of climate change. Adaptation and resilience is vital. This was a personal priority for me when I was International Development Secretary in our government. At the United Nations Climate Action Summit last September, working with Egypt and friends from Bangladesh, the Netherlands, Malawi and St Lucia, we launched a Call for Action. 118 nations and over 80 organisations committed to raising their ambition. When I revisited the UN in March, I met with these partners to discuss how we can translate these political commitments into on-the-ground action. That is what matters at the end of the day. And I look forward to sharing the results of this Coalition later in the year. At UNCAS, the UK and convening partners also launched the Risk-Informed Early Action Partnership. REAP as it’s known. REAP aims to make one billion people safer from disasters by 2025. Bringing together key actors from the climate, humanitarian, and development communities, the partnership will transform global capacity to act early against climate extremes and disasters. We all understand that better early warning systems and robust early action plans will give communities more time to prepare for extreme weather and ultimately save lives. The REAP secretariat, backed by the UK’s Department for International Development, is working closely with partners to develop a plan on delivering its ambitious targets. We will work with the donor community to push for £500 million in commitments to make these targets a reality. The UK has already committed £80 million. Of course, finance has a crucial role to play in adaptation and resilience. The UN Environment Programme has estimated that adapting to intensifying climate change impacts could cost anywhere between $140 billion to $300 billion per year by 2030. So, ahead of COP26, we will work with donor countries, Multilateral Development Banks and other public and private sources to increase access to finance for adaptation and resilience. This is an area where the UK is leading by example. Since 2011, UK International Climate Finance has supported 57 million people worldwide to cope with the effects of climate change. And in September, at the UN General Assembly, Prime Minister Boris Johnson committed the UK to doubling our contribution to £11.6 billion over the next five years to support developing countries. But I think we all recognise that public finance alone will not be enough. We must also mobilise private sector finance and make sure that climate risk is factored into every single investment decision taken around the world. That is why the UK Government is working with the Coalition for Climate Resilient Investment. A private sector-led initiative building resilience on-the-ground by quantifying, pricing and reducing the climate risks faced by new investments. Particularly in infrastructure. Since its launch last year, the Coalition has grown rapidly to over 50 members with over $8 trillion of assets under management. I would urge any financial institutions here today to join this Coalition. Ladies and gentlemen, friends, I believe that we are at a positive inflection point in our joint endeavour on climate action. As we recover from the Coronavirus pandemic we are seeing Governments, business, and civil society across the world uniting in their calls for climate action. According to polling firm Ipsos Mori, two thirds of the people on our planet believe that the climate crisis is as serious as Covid-19. Of course, countries around the world have responded with urgency to helping their populations through the Covid pandemic, as we have done in the UK. That is absolutely the right approach. And as we turn our attention to the economic fightback, we need to also reflect this desire to address the climate crisis in our economic response. On Tuesday, some of you will have seen that Prime Minister Boris Johnson unveiled an ambitious economic strategy for the UK. A ‘New Deal’ to help build our economy back to health. To build back better. And to build back greener. Of course, this opportunity does not just apply to the UK, but to every country in the world. We all have an opportunity to create a fairer, greener and more resilient global economy. One that puts adaptation and resilience right at its centre. And we can only achieve that in partnership with all of you. So I look forward to us continuing to come together in the lead up to COP26 to build on what we have already started. Thank you so much."
"Boris Johnson","PM words for NHS birthday: 5 July 2020","5 July 2020","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-words-for-nhs-birthday-5-july-2020","This year has seen the NHS gallantly respond to the greatest challenge it has ever faced and rightly receive unprecedented support. Week after week, we saw people take to their doorsteps, line the streets, lean precariously out of rainbow-bedecked windows to clap their hands and bang their saucepans to show their appreciation. I am proud to be once again clapping for our heroic NHS staff, alongside Anne-Marie Plas who launched this inspirational initiative. I am also celebrating today with staff from St Thomas’ Hospital who, quite simply, saved my life. As we mark seventy-two years of the NHS, I want to say how thankful I am of this world leading institution. As Prime Minister, I have given the NHS a £34 billion funding increase, the biggest in decades, and made sure it has every penny it needs to cope with coronavirus. I’m immensely proud that the organisation built by Beveridge, Bevan, Willink, Godber, and so many others, has grown into the spritely seventy-two year old we see today."
"Boris Johnson","Increasing ambition towards a climate-resilient, zero-carbon economy","7 July 2020","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/increasing-ambition-towards-a-climate-resilient-zero-carbon-economy","Thank you so much Selwin for that introduction. Ladies and Gentlemen, As we look forward to COP26 next November, our aim is to increase ambitions towards a climate-resilient, zero-carbon economy. Now we know that to limit warming to 1.5 degrees, we need to halve global emissions over the next decade. The current commitments made under the Paris Agreement fall far short of what is required. And that is why we are asking every country to submit enhanced Nationally Determined Contributions as well as an ambitious Long-Term Strategy, committing to further cuts in carbon emissions by 2030 and to reaching net zero as soon as possible. The UK will of course come forward with our own more ambitious NDC as soon as possible. And through programmes such as the NDC Partnership and the UK Green Recovery Challenge Fund, we continue to support other nations as they develop their plans and remain committed to fulfilling the $100 billion climate finance goal. The UNFCCC Secretariat’s NDC synthesis report will show us how far countries’ collective commitments take us towards the Paris goal, and the work left to do in Glasgow. In addition to the negotiations, the UK’s COP Presidency will focus efforts on five areas which need particular attention to achieve our goals. These are clean energy, clean transport, nature-based solutions, adaptation and resilience, and underpinning everything, finance. In energy, we can make the most of the low costs of renewables to boost growth and create jobs; By investing in zero-emission transport in a coordinated way, we can accelerate the transition to cleaner air; By incorporating adaptation and resilience into our recovery plans, we can better prepare for the next crisis while supporting the global economy; And by protecting and restoring nature, we can improve the resilience, sustainability and also the economics of agriculture; In all sectors, we must align our public and private finance with the Paris Agreement. Through these campaigns, we can not only ‘do no harm’, but also rebuild our economies better than ever before. Last week, Prime Minister Boris Johnson unveiled an ambitious economic strategy for the UK. A ‘New Deal’ to help build our economy back to health. To build back better. And to build back greener. Of course, this opportunity applies to every country in the word, not just the United Kingdom. We must collectively use the time ahead of COP26 to unite behind a fairer, greener and more resilient global economy. And we must come together to unleash the full potential of the Paris Agreement. Thank you."
"Boris Johnson","Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 31 July 2020","31 July 2020","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-31-july-2020","PM statement on coronavirus 31 July 2020 Good afternoon, Two weeks ago, I updated you from this podium on the progress we had made as a country against coronavirus. And in many ways that progress continues. The number of patients admitted to hospitals is still falling, and now stands at just over 100 each day. In April there were more than 3,000 coronavirus patients in mechanical ventilation beds, but now the latest figure is 87. The number of deaths continues to fall. That is obviously encouraging But I have also consistently warned that this virus could come back and that we would not hesitate to take swift and decisive action as required. I am afraid that in parts of Asia and Latin America the virus is now gathering pace. And our European friends are also struggling to keep the virus under control. As we see these rises around the world, we cannot fool ourselves that we are exempt. We must be willing to react to the first signs of trouble. Today, the weekly survey by the Office for National Statistics reports that the prevalence of the virus in the community in England is likely to be rising for the first time since May. Around 1 in 1,500 now have the virus, compared to 1 in 1,800 on 15 July and 1 in 2,000 on 2 July. The ONS also estimate there are now 4,900 new infections every day, up from around 3,000 per day on 14 July and 2,000 per day at the end of June We can’t afford to ignore this evidence. It’s vital to stress that we are in a far better position to keep the virus under control now than we were at the start of the pandemic – because we know so much more about the virus and have so many more tools at our disposal to deal with it. Our testing capacity has increased 100-fold. We have a contact tracing system up and running which has led to over 184,000 people isolating who may otherwise have spread the virus and is capable of tracing thousands of contacts every day. We have secured supplies of billions of items of PPE to withstand new demands on hospitals and care homes. And of course we have new treatments, like dexamethasone and remdesivir, to shorten recovery times and reduce mortality rates. But as I say, we cannot be complacent. I cannot – I won’t stand by and allow the virus to cause more pain and heartache in this country. Last night the Health Secretary announced new restrictions on household contact in the North West – specifically Greater Manchester, and parts of East Lancashire and West Yorkshire. These are targeted measures on social contact between households, which the data tells us is driving the current increase in cases. Businesses and workplaces should continue as before in those areas.I know how it is hard to have restrictions like this imposed on seeing your family and your friends. But we have to act rapidly in order to protect those we love. And we know this sort of intervention works – measures taken in Leicester and Luton have suppressed the virus, allowing us to relax measures. Even as we act locally, it is also my responsibility to look again at the measures we have in place nationally in light of the data we are seeing about incidence. At every point I have said our plan to reopen society and the economy is conditional – that it relies on continued progress against the virus, and that we would not hesitate to put on the brakes if required. With those numbers creeping up, our assessment is that we should now squeeze that brake pedal in order to keep the virus under control. On Saturday 1 August, you’ll remember, we had hoped to reopen in England a number of higher risk settings that had remained closed. Today, I am afraid we are postponing these changes for at least a fortnight. That means that, until 15 August at the earliest: Casinos, bowling alleys, skating rinks and remaining close contact services must remain closed. Indoor performances will not resume. Pilots of larger crowds in sports venues and conference centres will not take place. Wedding receptions of up to 30 people will not be permitted, but ceremonies can continue to take place, in line with COVID-Secure guidelines. I know that the steps we are taking will be a heavy blow to many people – to everyone whose wedding plans have been disrupted, or who now cannot celebrate Eid in the way they would wish, I am really, really sorry about that. But we simply cannot take the risk. We will of course study the data carefully and move forward with our intention to open up as soon as we possibly can. Two weeks ago, I also said that from tomorrow the government would give employers more discretion over how employees can work safely – whether by continuing to work from home or attending a Covid Secure workplace. We know that employers have gone to huge lengths to make workplaces safe, so that guidance remains unchanged. We also said we would pause shielding nationally from 1 August – based on clinical advice, that national pause will proceed as planned, and our medical experts will be explaining more about that decision later and about shielding later today. Most people in this country are following the rules and doing their bit to control the virus. But we must keep our discipline, we must be focused and we cannot be complacent. I have asked the Home Secretary to work with the police and others to ensure the rules which are already in place are properly enforced. That means local authorities acting to close down premises and cancel events which are not following Covid Secure guidance. And it means a greater police presence to ensure face coverings are being worn where this is required by law. We will also extend the requirement to wear a face covering to other indoor settings where you are likely to come into contact with people you do not normally meet, such as museums, galleries, cinemas and places of worship. We now recommend face coverings are worn in these settings, and this will become enforceable in law from 8 August. At this stage, we are not changing the rules on social contact nationally. I don’t want to tell people to spend less time with their friends. But unless people follow the rules and behave safely, we may need to go further. Two weeks ago, I said we would hope for the best but plan for the worst. And of course we continue to hope for the best. The way to get there and to achieve that optimum outcome is if we all follow the rules, wash our hands, cover our faces, keep our distance – and get a test if we have symptoms, so that NHS Test and Trace can keep the virus under control. This is how we will avoid a return to full national lockdown. We’ve made huge progress together. I know we are going succeed and I know we are going to beat this – if each and every one of us plays our part."
"Boris Johnson","Standing side by side, we'll build back better than ever","13 August 2020","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/standing-side-by-side-well-build-back-better-than-ever","The rainbow balloon stickers that still doggedly adhere to seemingly every commercial vehicle in the greater Belfast area brought a much-needed splash of colour and a sizeable serving of hope to the people of Northern Ireland during the toughest days of the Coronavirus lockdown. Sam McClean, the Belfast sign-maker who has been churning them out non-stop since April, has already raised north of £100,000 for the NHS and local charities – for which I was delighted to give him a special Point of Light award earlier this year. And while the stickers he has produced say a well-deserved “thank-you” to our amazing key workers, the way in which they rapidly spread to every part of Northern Ireland also says something about the way in which the people of this country pulled together in the fight against this awful virus. About the way dividing lines that have existed in the past simply ceased to matter in the face of a foe that cares nothing for politics or faith. In the kind of cross-community co-operation that the late John Hume spent his life promoting, we saw all the people of Northern Ireland coming together and looking out for one another, demonstrating quite remarkable levels of compassion, resilience and good humour. From manufacturers of baby equipment to distillers of gin, businesses across the country turned their hands to creating handwash, face masks, ventilators and more. And, just as Northern Ireland faced Coronavirus as one people, so the four nations of the UK faced it as one Union. Our combined strength and economic heft has allowed us to share and shoulder a burden that would have otherwise proved unbearable. What does that look like? It looks like almost a quarter of a million people across Northern Ireland having their jobs supported by the UK government’s relief schemes. It looks like nearly five million items of PPE committed to Northern Ireland from UK resources, and 250,000 medical-grade gowns heading from Northern Irish suppliers to frontline workers in England. Millions of pounds of support to keep Derry and Belfast airports open and vital air links running during the worst of the lockdown. And, as the Chancellor recently announced, at least £2.2 billion of additional funding for the Northern Ireland Executive this year. This is the kind of alchemy that happens when Stormont and Westminster work together, hand-in-glove. And I cannot overstate how important it is that this close co-operation continues as we strive to not simply rebuild in the wake of Coronavirus, but to come back stronger than ever, bigger than ever, better than ever and ready to take advantage of the innumerable opportunities that lie ahead. So when I meet with the First Minister and deputy First Minister today I won’t only be talking about the ongoing pandemic, vital though the fight against it remains. I’ll be talking about the unique freedoms Northern Ireland will enjoy when the Brexit transition period comes to an end in five months from now. About the £562 million City and Growth Deal programme, bringing opportunity and prosperity not just to Belfast but every part of Northern Ireland. And about our hugely exciting plans for marking Northern Ireland’s centenary – using UK Government funding from the New Decade, New Approach package to support a programme of events that will help people across the UK and around the world celebrate Northern Ireland and its integral place within the United Kingdom. All of these are serious issues for Northern Ireland’s leaders, yes. But they are also just as important to me as what’s going on in London or Liverpool or Leeds. Because this government has an unshakeable commitment to each and every person in each and every nation of our United Kingdom. And, just as we continue to fight Coronavirus together, so we will stand side by side as we build back better, constructing the kind of exciting, strong, prosperous Northern Ireland that all of us want to see."
"Boris Johnson","Prime Minister's words on EU negotiations: 7 September 2020","7 September 2020","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-words-on-eu-negotiations-7-september-2020","We are now entering the final phase of our negotiations with the EU. The EU have been very clear about the timetable. I am too. There needs to be an agreement with our European friends by the time of the European Council on 15 October if it’s going to be in force by the end of the year. So there is no sense in thinking about timelines that go beyond that point. If we can’t agree by then, then I do not see that there will be a free trade agreement between us, and we should both accept that and move on. We will then have a trading arrangement with the EU like Australia’s. I want to be absolutely clear that, as we have said right from the start, that would be a good outcome for the UK. As a Government we are preparing, at our borders and at our ports, to be ready for it. We will have full control over our laws, our rules, and our fishing waters. We will have the freedom to do trade deals with every country in the world. And we will prosper mightily as a result. We will of course always be ready to talk to our EU friends even in these circumstances. We will be ready to find sensible accommodations on practical issues such as flights, lorry transport, or scientific cooperation, if the EU wants to do that. Our door will never be closed and we will trade as friends and partners – but without a free trade agreement. There is still an agreement to be had. We will continue to work hard in September to achieve it. It is one based on our reasonable proposal for a standard free trade agreement like the one the EU has agreed with Canada and so many others. Even at this late stage, if the EU are ready to rethink their current positions and agree this I will be delighted. But we cannot and will not compromise on the fundamentals of what it means to be an independent country to get it."
"Boris Johnson","Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 9 September 2020","9 September 2020","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-press-conference-statement-9-september-2020","PM press conference statement 9 September 2020 Good afternoon, Welcome back to Downing Street for an update on coronavirus as we enter autumn and approach winter. I will first hand over to Chris to take us through the latest data before I set out how we are responding to it. Thank you Chris. It is clear from that very powerful graphic that we must act. The most important thing every one of us must do is remember the basics. First, wash your hands, regularly and for 20 seconds. Don’t get back into old habits, it is so vital. Second, wear a face covering over your mouth and nose if you are in an enclosed space and in close contact with people you don’t normally meet. I know wearing a face covering feels odd to some people and I understand that. But face coverings do make it harder for the virus to spread – so please, wear one to protect others. Third, make space. Always stay 2 metres away from people you don’t live with – or 1 metre with extra precautions, like extra ventilation, screens, or face coverings. Fourth, if you have COVID symptoms, get a test and self-isolate. We are now processing 1.2 million tests a week. To date we have carried out 15.4 million antigen tests – that’s more than any other country in Europe, and more per head than other European countries like Germany and Spain. We are increasing our testing capacity further to meet rising demand. You can help by only booking a test if you have a fever, a new continuous cough, or you’ve lost your sense of taste or smell – if you don’t have those symptoms and haven’t been asked to book a test, please don’t. So those are the basics – hands, face, space – and get a test if you have COVID symptoms. Since the pandemic began, we have asked you to reduce your social contact and limit your interactions with friends and family. I know that, over time, the rules have become quite complicated and confusing. We have spoken to police officers about what they need for an effective enforcement regime and of course, listened to the feedback from you, the public. In response, we are simplifying and strengthening the rules – making them easier for you to understand and for the police to enforce. I should stress that if we are to beat the virus then everyone, at all times, should limit social contact as much as possible and minimise interactions with other households. It is safer to meet outdoors and you should keep your distance from anyone you don’t live with, even if they are close friends or family. So in England, from Monday, we are introducing the rule of 6. You must not meet socially in groups of more than 6 – and if you do, you will be breaking the law. This will apply in any setting, indoors or outdoors, at home or in the pub. The ban will be set out in law and it will be enforced by the police – anyone breaking the rules risks being dispersed, fined and possibly arrested. This single measure replaces both the existing ban on gatherings of more than 30 and the current guidance on allowing 2 households to meet indoors. Now you only need to remember the rule of 6. There will be some limited exemptions. For example, if a single household or support bubble is larger than 6, they can still gather. COVID Secure venues like places of worship, gyms, restaurants and hospitality venues can still hold more than 6 people in total. Within those venues however, there must not be individual groups larger than 6, and groups must not mix socially or form larger groups. Education and work settings are unaffected, COVID Secure weddings and funerals can go ahead, up to a limit of 30 people, and organised sport will still be able to proceed. As we have found on previous occasions, this rule of 6 will of course throw up difficult cases. For example, two whole households will no longer be able to meet if they would together exceed the limit of 6 people. I am sorry about that and I wish that we did not have to take this step. But, as your Prime Minister, I must do what is necessary to stop the spread of the virus and to save lives. We will of course keep the rule of 6 under constant review and only keep it in place as long as it’s necessary. I also want to see – and the public wants to see – stronger enforcement of the rules which are already in place. So I’ve have tasked the Cabinet with increasing enforcement and I would like to thank the police, as always, and other authorities for the work they are doing to keep us all safe. In future: Premises and venues where people meet socially will be legally required to request the contact details of a member of every party, record and retain these details for 21 days, and provide them to NHS Test & Trace without delay when required. We will support local authorities to make further and faster use of their powers to close venues that are breaking the rules and pose a risk to public health. Fines will be levied against hospitality venues that fail to ensure their premises remain COVID Secure. We will boost the enforcement capacity of local authorities by introducing COVID Secure Marshalls to help ensure social distancing in town and city centres, and by setting up a register of Environmental Health Officers that local authorities can draw upon for support. We will simplify the Passenger Locator Form needed for travelling to the UK, and take measures to ensure these are completed and checked before departure. Border Force will step up enforcement efforts at the border to ensure arrivals are complying with the quarantine rules. We will also restrict the opening hours of premises, initially in some local areas. At the present time we must also, I’m afraid, revise plans to pilot larger audiences in venues later this month and review our intention to return audiences to stadiums and conference centres from 1 October. That doesn’t mean we’re going to scrap the programme entirely it just means we are going to review and abridge it, and the Culture Secretary will say more shortly. Let me be clear – these measures are not a second national lockdown – the whole point of them is to avoid a second national lockdown. By bearing down on social contact and improving enforcement, we can keep schools and businesses open, in the knowledge they are COVID Secure. I have always said schools and colleges should only ever be shut again as a very, very last resort. As the Chief Medical Officer and Chief Scientific Adviser have said, the long term risks to children’s life chances of not going to school are significant and far greater than the health risks of going back to school. Indeed it’s been fantastic to see so many children back in school this term and I want, once again, to thank all our teachers, and to reassure parents and pupils that schools are safe. University terms will also begin soon. Opening universities is critical, again, for students’ life chances and, again, the health risks to individuals are low. Of course, many university students are in the age bracket where we have seen the infection rates rise recently as Chris was just explaining. My message to students is simple. Please, for the sake of your education and your parents’ and your grandparents’ health: wash your hands, cover your face, make space, and don’t socially gather in groups of more than 6, now and when term starts. Today the Department for Education is publishing updated guidance for universities on how they can operate in a COVID Secure way, including a clear request not to send students home in the event of an outbreak, so as to avoid spreading the virus across the country. I am very grateful to universities for their continued cooperation and planning for the return of students. The measures I have set out today will help us control the virus but won’t, on their own, be enough to allow a more significant return to normality. Patrick is going to set out in a moment where we are on vaccines and treatments in a moment, but we are not there yet and there are no guarantees. So over the summer, we have therefore been working up an alternative plan which could allow life to return closer to normality. And that plan is based on mass testing. Up to now, we have used testing primarily to identify people who are positive – so we can isolate them from the community and protect high risk groups. And that will continue to be our priority. We are working hard to increase our testing capacity to 500,000 tests a day by the end of October. But in future, in the near future, we want to start using testing to identify people who are negative – who don’t have coronavirus and who are not infectious - so we can allow them to behave in a more normal way, in the knowledge they cannot infect anyone else with the virus. And we think, we hope, we believe that new types of test which are simple, quick and scalable will become available. They use swabs or saliva and can turn round results in 90 or even 20 minutes. Crucially, it should be possible to deploy these tests on a far bigger scale than any country has yet achieved – literally millions of tests processed every single day. That level of testing would allow people to lead more normal lives, without the need for social distancing: Theatres and sports venues could test all audience members on the day and let in those with a negative result, all those who are not infectious. Workplaces could be opened up to all those who test negative that morning and allow them to behave in a way that was normal before COVID. Those isolating because they are a contact, or quarantining after travelling abroad, could after a period be tested and released. Now that is an ambitious agenda, but we are going to pilot this approach in Salford from next month, with audiences in indoor and outdoor venues. And then we hope to go nationwide. There are a number of challenges. We need the technology to work. We need to source the necessary materials to manufacture so many tests. We need to put in place an efficient distribution network. And we need to work through the numerous logistical challenges. And as I say, we are not there yet, and I should repeat that, as we manage this period of high demand, it is especially important that if individuals don’t have symptoms, and have not been specifically advised to take a test, they should not be coming forward for a test - because they could be taking a test away from someone who really needs it. Our plan – this moonshot that I am describing – will require a giant, collaborative effort from government, business, public health professionals, scientists, logistics experts and many, many more. Work is underway – and we will get on at pace until we get there, round the clock. We are hopeful this approach will be widespread by the spring and, if everything comes together, it may be possible even for challenging sectors like theatres to have life much closer to normal before Christmas. But as I have said before, all this progress is contingent on continued scientific advances and though we’re hopeful, I cannot 100% guarantee that those advances will be made. That is why it is so important that we take these tough measures now. I believe we will continue to drive this virus down and that we will beat this virus before too long. So let’s work together and follow the rules: meet in groups of no more than six. Wash your hands, cover your face, and make space. I will now hand over to Patrick to set out the latest on vaccines and treatments, and then we’ll go to questions from the public and the media."
"Boris Johnson","Prime Minister's article in the Telegraph: 12 September 2020","12 September 2020","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-article-in-the-telegraph-12-september-2020","It is now more than seven months since this country left the EU on Jan 31, and since then we have been working hard to build what I am sure will be a great new future relationship. We want a thoroughgoing free-trade deal. We want a deal like the one between the EU and Canada; and since we currently conform with every jot and tittle of EU regulation, and since we have been loyal and paid-up members for more than four decades, it strikes me that if the EU is willing to offer these terms to Canada, then it makes sense to offer the same to us. Our partners know that whatever happens, the UK is their friend, their biggest single export market, and committed forever to the peace and security of the European continent. They know that there are ways in which we want to continue and even deepen our relations – not just in trade. As I have never tired of saying, we have left the EU, but we have not left Europe. But they also know – or at least they know now - that leaving the EU means that the UK is serious about its newfound sovereignty. In forging our new relationships, we can’t have our lives or our economy regulated by the European Court; we must have the right to devise our own laws and regulations. And we must have sole control of our spectacular marine wealth – our fisheries. Those are some of our conditions, and in the last few months I believe we have made considerable progress. If both sides want it, there is a great free trade deal there to be done. So I have become anxious in the last few weeks to discover that there is an obstacle. Our negotiators believe that there may be a serious misunderstanding about the terms of the Withdrawal Agreement that we reached last October. You may remember those days. They were torrid. We were negotiating with one hand tied behind our back, since parliament had voted to deprive the UK side of the right to walk away. We had a deadline of October 31 – which parliament decided to flout. MPs were in a state of constant turmoil and recrimination. And yet, provided it was applied in good faith, the Withdrawal agreement we reached was extremely good. We excised the baleful presence of the Northern Ireland “backstop” – which effectively kept this country locked in the EU’s legal orbit, forced to accept EU laws, unable to do free trade deals. We made sure that Northern Ireland was explicitly recognised as part of the customs territory of the United kingdom, and able to take part fully in new free trade agreements (such as the one Liz Truss has just done with Japan). And we also took steps to protect free movement at the all-important border between Northern Ireland and Ireland. We agreed that in some limited ways Northern Ireland would continue to conform with EU law for four years. We agreed that this limited alignment would end, unless the Northern Irish assembly voted to continue it. We agreed to do some light-touch checks on goods arriving in Northern Ireland, in case they should go on to Ireland, in order to avoid checks at the North-South border. And on the basis of that excellent deal we left the EU – and so it is deeply regrettable that what seemed so simple and clear to us is seen very differently by our EU friends. We decided in the Withdrawal Agreement to create a Joint Committee, in which we would thrash out the details of these new arrangements. It is here that things risk coming unstuck. We are now hearing that unless we agree to the EU’s terms, the EU will use an extreme interpretation of the Northern Ireland protocol to impose a full-scale trade border down the Irish sea. We are being told that the EU will not only impose tariffs on goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, but that they might actually stop the transport of food products from GB to NI. I have to say that we never seriously believed that the EU would be willing to use a Treaty, negotiated in good faith, to blockade one part of the UK, to cut it off; or that they would actually threaten to destroy the economic and territorial integrity of the UK. This was for the very good reason that any such barrier, any such tariffs or division would be completely contrary to the letter and the spirit of the Good Friday agreement. By actively undermining the Union of our country, such an interpretation would seriously endanger peace and stability in Northern Ireland. This interpretation cannot have been the real intention of those who framed the protocol (it certainly wasn’t ours) – and it is therefore vital that we close that option down. We want an agreement in the Joint Committee, on how we can implement the protocol. We have consistently shown that we are willing to help our friends – to the extent that is possible and reasonable – to protect the integrity of their Single Market, and to keep a fluid North-South border. But we cannot leave the theoretical power to carve up our country – to divide it – in the hands of an international organisation. We have to protect the UK from that disaster, and that is why we have devised a legal safety net – in the UK internal market Bill – to clarify the position, and to sort out the inconsistencies. This Bill protects jobs and growth across the UK, by preventing barriers to trade between the nations and regions. It means that anything approved for sale in Scotland or Wales must be good for sale in England or Northern Ireland, and vice versa. The Bill gives freedoms and certainties for businesses and citizens that were previously set out in EU law. That is why, as we now come out of the EU, this Bill is absolutely vital. It is now also clear that we need this Bill to protect the free flow of goods and services between NI and the rest of the UK, and to make sense of that commitment in the EU withdrawal agreement – that NI is part of the UK customs territory. It is therefore crucial for peace, and for the Union itself. We must get this Bill through. So I say to my fellow parliamentarians that we cannot go back to the dark days of last year – the squabbling that so undermined our negotiators. If we fail to pass this Bill, or if we weaken its protections, then we will in fact reduce the chances of getting that Canada-style deal. As it happens, I believe that this country will prosper mightily in either event. We could do very well indeed if we left on Australian terms. But there is no doubt that in the short term at least the Canada deal would be better and smoother – and that is what we are pitching for. So let’s end any potential for misunderstanding. Let’s remove this danger to the very fabric of the United Kingdom. Let’s make the EU take their threats off the table. And let’s get this Bill through, back up our negotiators, and protect our country."
"Boris Johnson","Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 22 September 2020","22 September 2020","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-22-september-2020","PM address the nation on coronavirus 22 September Good evening, the struggle against covid is the single biggest crisis the world has faced in my lifetime. In less than a year this disease has killed almost a million people, and caused havoc to economies everywhere. Here in the UK we mourn every person we have lost, and we grieve with their families. And yet I am more certain than ever that this is a struggle that humanity will win, and we in this country will win – and to achieve what we must I want to talk to you directly tonight about the choices that we face – none of them easy – and why we must take action now. I know that we can succeed because we have succeeded before. When the sickness took hold in this country in March, we pulled together in a spirit of national sacrifice and community. We followed the guidance to the letter. We stayed at home, protected the NHS, and saved thousands of lives. And for months with those disciplines of social distancing we have kept that virus at bay. But we have to acknowledge this this is a great and freedom-loving country; and while the vast majority have complied with the rules there have been too many breaches – too many opportunities for our invisible enemy to slip through undetected. The virus has started to spread again in an exponential way. Infections are up, hospital admissions are climbing. We can see what is happening in France and Spain, and we know, alas, that this virus is no less fatal than it was in the spring, and that the vast majority of our people are no less susceptible, and the iron laws of geometrical progression are shouting at us from the graphs that we risk many more deaths, many more families losing loved ones before their time; and I know that faced with that risk the British people will want their government to continue to fight to protect them, you, and that is what we are doing, night and day. And yet the single greatest weapon we bring to this fight is the common sense of the people themselves – the joint resolve of this country to work together to suppress covid now. So today I set out a package of tougher measures in England – early closing for pubs, bars; table service only; closing businesses that are not covid secure; expanding the use of face coverings, and new fines for those that fail to comply; and once again asking office workers to work from home if they can while enforcing the rule of six indoors and outdoors – a tougher package of national measures combined with the potential for tougher local restrictions for areas already in lockdown. I know that this approach – robust but proportionate – already carries the support of all the main parties in parliament. After discussion with colleagues in the Devolved Administrations, I believe this broad approach is shared across the whole UK. And to those who say we don’t need this stuff, and we should leave people to take their own risks, I say these risks are not our own. The tragic reality of having covid is that your mild cough can be someone else’s death knell. And as for the suggestion that we should simply lock up the elderly and the vulnerable – with all the suffering that would entail – I must tell you that this is just not realistic, because if you let the virus rip through the rest of the population it would inevitably find its way through to the elderly as well, and in much greater numbers. That’s why we need to suppress the virus now, and as for that minority who may continue to flout the rules, we will enforce those rules with tougher penalties and fines of up to £10,000. We will put more police out on the streets and use the army to backfill if necessary. And of course I am deeply, spiritually reluctant to make any of these impositions, or infringe anyone’s freedom, but unless we take action the risk is that we will have to go for tougher measures later, when the deaths have already mounted and we have a huge caseload of infection such as we had in the spring. If we let this virus get out of control now, it would mean that our NHS had no space – once again – to deal with cancer patients and millions of other non-covid medical needs. And if we were forced into a new national lockdown, that would threaten not just jobs and livelihoods but the loving human contact on which we all depend. It would mean renewed loneliness and confinement for the elderly and vulnerable, and ultimately it would threaten once again the education of our children. We must do all we can to avoid going down that road again. But if people don’t follow the rules we have set out, then we must reserve the right to go further. We must take action now because a stitch in time saves nine; and this way we can keep people in work, we can keep our shops and our schools open, and we can keep our country moving forward while we work together to suppress the virus. That is our strategy, and if we can follow this package together, then I know we can succeed because in so many ways we are better prepared than before. We have the PPE, we have the beds, we have the Nightingales, we have new medicines – pioneered in this country – that can help save lives. And though our doctors and our medical advisers are rightly worried about the data now, and the risks over winter, they are unanimous that things will be far better by the spring, when we have not only the hope of a vaccine, but one day soon – and I must stress that we are not there yet - of mass testing so efficient that people will be able to be tested in minutes so they can do more of the things they love. That’s the hope; that’s the dream. It’s hard, but it’s attainable, and we are working as hard as we can to get there. But until we do, we must rely on our willingness to look out for each other, to protect each other. Never in our history has our collective destiny and our collective health depended so completely on our individual behaviour. If we follow these simple rules together, we will get through this winter together. There are unquestionably difficult months to come. And the fight against covid is by no means over. I have no doubt, however, that there are great days ahead. But now is the time for us all to summon the discipline, and the resolve, and the spirit of togetherness that will carry us through."
"Boris Johnson","PM Commons statement on coronavirus: 22 September 2020","22 September 2020","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-commons-statement-on-coronavirus-22-september-2020","Mr Speaker, with your permission, I will make a statement on our response to the rising number of Coronavirus cases and how we must act now to avoid still graver consequences later on. At every stage in this pandemic we have struck a delicate balance between saving lives by protecting our NHS and minimising the wider impact of our restrictions. And it is because of the common sense and fortitude of the British people that earlier this year we were able to avert an even worse catastrophe, forming a human shield around our NHS, and then by getting our country moving again by reopening key sectors of our economy and returning children to school. But we always knew that while we might have driven the virus into retreat, the prospect of a second wave was real. And I am sorry to say that - as in Spain and France and many other countries - we have reached a perilous turning point. A month ago, on average around a thousand people across the UK were testing positive for Coronavirus every day. The latest figure has almost quadrupled to 3,929. Yesterday the Chief Medical Officer and Chief Scientific Adviser warned that the doubling rate for new cases could be between seven and 20 days with the possibility of tens of thousands of new infections next month. I wish I could reassure the House that the growing number of cases is merely a function of more testing, but a rising proportion of the tests themselves are yielding a positive result. I also wish I could say that more of our people now have the antibodies to keep the virus off, but the latest data suggest that fewer than 8 per cent of us are in this position. It is true that the number of new cases is growing fastest amongst those aged 20-29, but the evidence shows that the virus is spreading to other more vulnerable age groups, as we have seen in France and Spain where this has led to increased hospital admissions and, sadly, more deaths. In the last fortnight, daily hospital admissions in England have more than doubled. Tens of thousands of daily infections in October would, as night follows day, lead to hundreds of daily deaths in November and those numbers would continue to grow unless we act. And as with all respiratory viruses, Covid is likely to spread faster as autumn becomes winter. Yesterday, on the advice of the four Chief Medical Officers, the UK’s Covid alert level was raised from 3 to 4, the second most serious stage, meaning that transmission is high or rising exponentially. So this is the moment when we must act. If we can curb the number of daily infections, and reduce the Reproduction rate to 1, then we can save lives, protect the NHS, and the most vulnerable, and shelter the economy from the far sterner and more costly measures that would inevitably become necessary later. So we are acting on the principle that a stitch in time saves nine. The Government will introduce new restrictions in England, carefully judged to achieve the maximum reduction in the R number with the minimum damage to lives and livelihoods. I want to stress that this is by no means a return to the full lockdown of March. We are not issuing a general instruction to stay at home. We will ensure that schools, colleges and universities stay open - because nothing is more important than the education, health and well-being of our young people. We will ensure that businesses can stay open in a Covid-compliant way. However, we must take action to suppress the disease. First, we are once again asking office workers who can work from home to do so. In key public services – and in all professions where homeworking is not possible, such as construction or retail – people should continue to attend their workplaces. And like Government, this House will be free to take forward its business in a Covid-secure way which you, Mr Speaker, have pioneered. Second, from Thursday all pubs, bars and restaurants must operate table-service only, Mr Speaker, except for takeaways. Together with all hospitality venues, they must close at 10pm. To help the police to enforce this rule, I am afraid that means alas closing, and not just calling for last orders. Simplicity is paramount. The same will apply to takeaways - though deliveries can continue thereafter. I am sorry this will hurt many businesses just getting back on their feet, but we must act to stop the virus from being transmitted in bars and restaurants. Third, we will extend the requirement to wear face coverings to include staff in retail, all users of taxis and private hire vehicles, and staff and customers in indoor hospitality, except when seated at a table to eat or drink. Fourth, in retail, leisure, tourism and other sectors, our Covid-secure guidelines will become legal obligations. Businesses will be fined and could be closed if they breach these rules. Fifth, now is the time to tighten up the rule of six. I’m afraid that from Monday, a maximum of 15 people will be able to attend wedding ceremonies and receptions. Though, up to 30 can still attend a funeral as now. We will also have to extend the rule of six to all adult indoor team sports. Finally, we have to acknowledge that the spread of the virus is now affecting our ability to reopen business conferences, exhibitions and large sporting events so we will not be able to do this from 1 October. And I recognise the implications for our sports clubs, which are the life and soul of our communities, and my RH Friends the Chancellor and Culture Secretary are working urgently on what we can do now to support them. Mr Speaker, these rules measures will only work if people comply. There is nothing more frustrating for the vast majority, the law-abiding majority that do comply than the sight of a few brazenly defying the rules. So these rules will be enforced by tighter penalties. We have already introduced a fine of up to £10,000 for those who fail to self-isolate and such fines will now be applied to businesses breaking Covid rules. The penalty for failing to wear a mask or breaking the rule of six will now double to £200 for a first offence. We will provide the police and local authorities with the extra funding they need, a greater police presence on our streets, and the option to draw on military support where required to free up the police. The measures I have announced all apply in England and the Devolved Administrations are taking similar steps. I spoke yesterday with each of the First Ministers and again today and I thank them for their collaboration: the health of everyone in these islands depends on our common success. Already about 13 million people across England are living under various local restrictions, over and above national measures. We will continue to act against local flare-ups, working alongside councils and strengthening measures where necessary. And I want to speak directly to those who were shielding early in the pandemic and may be anxious about being at greater risk. Following advice from our senior clinicians, our guidance continues to be that you do not need to shield – except in local lockdown areas – and we will keep this under constant review. I must emphasise that if all our actions fail to bring the R below 1, then we reserve the right to deploy greater firepower, with significantly greater restrictions. I fervently want to avoid taking this step, as do the Devolved Administrations, but we will only be able to avoid it if our new measures work and our behaviour changes. Mr Speaker, we will spare no effort in developing vaccines, treatments and new forms of mass-testing but unless we palpably make progress, we should assume that the restrictions I have announced will remain in place for perhaps six months. For the time being, this virus is a fact of our lives and I must tell the House and the country that our fight against it will continue. We will not listen to those who say let the virus rip; nor to those who urge a permanent lockdown; we are taking decisive and appropriate steps to balance saving lives with protecting jobs and livelihoods. I know all of this will have profound consequences for our constituents, so the government will give the House every opportunity to scrutinise our decisions. In addition to regular statements and debates, Hon Members will be able to question the government’s scientific advisers more regularly, gain access to data about their constituencies, your constituencies and join daily calls with my RH Friend the Paymaster General. After six months of restrictions, it would be tempting to hope that the threat has faded, and seek comfort in the belief that if you have avoided the virus so far then you are somehow immune. I have to say that it is that kind of complacency that could be our undoing. If we fail to act together now we will not only place others at risk but jeopardise our own futures with the more drastic action that we would inevitably be forced to take. Mr Speaker, no British government would wish to stifle our freedoms in the ways that we have found necessary this year. Yet even now we can draw some comfort from the fact that schools and universities and places of worship are staying open, shops can serve their customers, construction workers can go to building sites, and the vast majority of the UK economy can continue moving forwards. We are also, Mr Speaker, better prepared for a second wave, with the ventilators, the PPE, the dexamethasone, the Nightingale Hospitals, and a hundred times as much testing. So now it falls to each of us and every one of us to remember the basics – wash our hands, cover our faces, observe social distancing – and follow the rules. Then we can fight back against this virus, shelter our economy from even greater damage, protect the most vulnerable in care homes and hospitals, safeguard our NHS and save many more lives. And I commend this statement to the House."
"Boris Johnson","Prime Minister's speech to United Nations General Assembly: 26 September 2020","26 September 2020","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-speech-to-un-general-assembly-26-september-2020","Watch the Prime Minister’s speech Never in the history of our species – not since the Almighty felled the Tower of Babel – has the human race been so obsessed with one single topic of conversation. We have been following the same debates, researching the potential of the same drugs, and time and again we have been typing the same word into our search engines. COVID-19, coronavirus, has united humanity as never before. And yet the crisis has also been an extraordinary force for division. We have all been up against the same enemy. The same tiny opponent threatening everyone in much the same way, but members of the UN have still waged 193 separate campaigns, as if every country somehow contains a different species of human being. Across the world there has been an infinite variety of curfews and restrictions and closures, and we have fought in a spirit of sauve qui peut. And the pace has been so urgent and the pressures so intense that each national government – democracy or otherwise – has decided entirely understandably to put the interests of its domestic population first. We have seen borders spring up between friends and allies, sometimes without consultation. We have seen the disruption of global supply chains with cheque book wars on airport tarmacs as nation has vied with nation for a supply of PPE. And after 9 months of fighting COVID-19, the very notion of the international community looks, frankly, pretty tattered. And we know that we simply can’t continue in this way. Unless we get our act together. Unless we unite and turn our fire against our common foe, we know that everyone will lose. The inevitable outcome would be to prolong this calamity and increase the risk of another. Now is the time – therefore, here at what I devoutly hope will be the first and last ever Zoom UNGA – for humanity to reach across borders and repair these ugly rifts. Let’s heal the world – literally and metaphorically. And let’s begin with the truth, because as someone once said, the truth shall set you free. And with nearly a million people dead, with colossal economic suffering already inflicted and more to come, there is a moral imperative for humanity to be honest and to reach a joint understanding of how the pandemic began, and how it was able to spread – Not because I want to blame any country or government, or to score points. I simply believe – as a former COVID patient – that we all have a right to know, so that we can collectively do our best to prevent a recurrence. And so the UK supports the efforts of the World Health Organisation and of my friend, Tedros, to explore the aetiology of the disease, because however great the need for reform, the WHO, the World Health Organization, is still the one body that marshals humanity against the legions of disease. That is why we in the UK – global Britain – are one of the biggest global funders of that organisation, contributing £340 million over the next 4 years, that’s an increase of 30%. And as we now send our medical detectives to interview the witnesses and the suspects – bats, the pangolins, whoever – we should have enough humility to acknowledge that alarm bells were ringing before this calamity struck. In the last 20 years, there have been 8 outbreaks of a lethal virus, any of which could have escalated into a pandemic. Bill Gates sounded the alert in 2015, 5 years ago he gave that amazing prediction – almost every word of which has come true – and we responded as if to a persistent Microsoft error message by clicking ‘ok’ and carrying on. Humanity was caught napping. We have been scrabbling to catch up, and with agonising slowness we are making progress. Epidemiologists at Oxford University identified the first treatment for COVID-19. They did trials with our national health service and found that a cheap medicine called dexamethasone reduces the risk of death by over a third for patients on ventilators. The UK immediately shared this discovery with the world, so that as many as 1.4 million lives could be saved in the next six months by this one, single advance. And as I speak there are 100 potential vaccines that are trying to clear the hurdles of safety and efficacy, as if in a giant global steeplechase. We don’t know which may be successful. We do not know if any of them will be successful. The Oxford vaccine is now in stage 3 of clinical trials, and in case of success AstraZeneca has already begun to manufacture millions of doses, in readiness for rapid distribution, and they have reached agreement with the Serum Institute of India to supply one billion doses to low and middle-income countries. But it would be futile to treat the quest for a vaccine as a contest for narrow national advantage and immoral to seek a head start through obtaining research by underhand means. The health of every country depends on the whole world having access to a safe and effective vaccine, wherever a breakthrough might occur; and, the UK, we will do everything in our power to bring this about. We are already the biggest single donor to the efforts of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness to find a vaccine. And it is precisely because we know that no-one is safe until everyone is safe, that I can announce that the UK will contribute up to £571 million to COVAX, a new initiative designed to distribute a COVID-19 vaccine across the world. Of this sum, £500 million will be for developing countries to protect themselves. The UK is already the biggest donor to Gavi, the global vaccine alliance. In June we helped to raise almost $9 billion to immunise another 300 million children against killer diseases, and Gavi also stands ready to help distribute a COVID-19 vaccine. But even as we strive for a vaccine, we must never cut corners, slim down the trials or sacrifice safety to speed. Because it would be an absolute tragedy if in our eagerness, we were to boost the nutjobs – the anti vaxxers, dangerous obsessives who campaign against the whole concept of vaccination and who would risk further millions of lives. And now is the time above all to look ahead and think now about how to stop a pandemic from happening again. How can we stop another virus from coming along and again smashing that precious Ming vase of international cooperation? How can we avoid the mutual quarantines and the brutal Balkanisation of the world economy? I don’t think there is any reason for fatalism: of course, the dangers can never be wholly eliminated, but human ingenuity and expertise can reduce the risk. Imagine how much suffering might have been avoided if we had already identified the pathogen that became COVID-19 while it was still confined to animals? Suppose we had been able to reach immediately into a global medicine chest and take out a treatment? What if countries had been ready to join together from the outset to develop and trial a vaccine? And think how much strife would have been prevented if the necessary protocols – covering quarantine and data-sharing and PPE and so much else – had, so far as possible, been ready on the shelf for humanity to use? So we in the UK we’re going to work with our friends, we’re going to use our G7 presidency next year to create a new global approach to health security based on a 5-point plan to protect humanity against another pandemic. Our first aim should be to stop a new disease before it starts. About 60% of the pathogens circulating in the human population originated in animals and leapt from one species to the other in a ‘zoonotic’ transmission. The world could seek to minimise the danger by forging a global network of zoonotic research hubs, charged with spotting dangerous animal pathogens that may cross the species barrier and infect human beings. The UK is ready to harness its scientific expertise and cooperate to the fullest extent with our global partners to this end. Of the billions of pathogens, the great mass are thankfully incapable of vaulting the species barrier. Once we discover the dangerous ones, our scientists could get to work on identifying their weaknesses and refining anti-viral treatments before they strike. We could open the research to every country and as we learn more, our scientists might begin to assemble an armoury of therapies – a global pharmacopoeia – ready to make the treatment for the next COVID-19. Our second step should be to develop the manufacturing capacity for treatments and vaccines So that the whole of humanity can hold them like missiles in silos ready to zap the alien organisms before they can attack. But if that fails and a new disease jumps from animals to human beings and overcomes our armoury of therapies and begins to spread, then we need to know what’s going on as fast as possible. So the third objective should be to design a global pandemic early warning system, based on a vast expansion of our ability to collect and analyse samples and distribute the findings, using health data-sharing agreements covering every country. As far as possible, we should aim to predict a pandemic almost as we forecast the weather to see the thunderstorm in the cloud no bigger than a man’s hand. And if all our defences are breached, and we face another crisis, we should at least be able to rely on our fourth step, and have all the protocols ready for an emergency response, covering every relevant issue, along with the ability to devise new ones swiftly. Never again must we wage 193 different campaigns against the same enemy. As with all crises, it is crucial not to learn the wrong lessons. After the harrowing struggle to equip ourselves with enough ventilators – with countries scrabbling to improvise like the marooned astronauts of Apollo 13 – there is a global movement to onshore manufacturing. That is understandable. Here in the UK we found ourselves unable to make gloves, aprons, enzymes which an extraordinary position for a country that was once the workshop of the world. We need to rediscover that latent gift and instinct, but it would be insane to ignore the insights of Adam Smith and David Ricardo. We need secure supply chains – but we should still rely on the laws of comparative advantage and the invisible hand of the market. Many countries imposed export controls at the outset of the pandemic, about two thirds of which remain in force. Governments still target their trade barriers on exactly what we most need to combat the virus, with tariffs on disinfectant often exceeding 10%, and for soap tariffs for 30%. So I would urge every country to take a fifth step and lift the export controls wherever possible – and agree not to revive them – and cancel any tariffs on the vital tools of our struggle: gloves, protective equipment, thermometers and other COVID-critical products. The UK will do this as soon as our new independent tariff regime comes into effect on 1st January and I hope others will do the same. Though the world is still in the throes of this pandemic, all these steps are possible if we have the will. They are the right way forward for the world, and Britain is the right country to give that lead. And we will do so in 2021, as we celebrate the 75th anniversary of the founding of this great United Nations in London in January, and through our G7 Presidency, and as we host the world’s climate change summit, COP26, in Glasgow next November. The COVID-19 pandemic has been an immense psychic shock to the human race. Global fears have been intensified by the immediacy of round the clock news and social media. We sometimes forget, we face a virus – a small package of nucleic acid that simply replicates. It is not even technically alive. Tragic as its consequences have been, it has been nothing like as destructive as other plagues – let alone the influenza of a century ago. It is absurd, in many ways, outrageous that this microscopic enemy should have routed the unity of the human race. COVID-19 has caused us to cease other vital work, and I’m afraid it made individual nations seem selfish and divided from each other. Every day people were openly encouraged to study a grisly reverse Olympic league table, and to take morbid and totally mistaken comfort in the greater sufferings of others. We cannot go on like that, we cannot make these mistakes again. And here in the UK, the birthplace of Edward Jenner who pioneered the world’s first vaccine We are determined to do everything in our power to work with our friends across the UN, to heal those divisions and to heal the world."
"Boris Johnson","PM's skills speech: 29 September 2020","29 September 2020","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pms-skills-speech-29-september-2020","There are many reasons to – for me I should say – to come here to Exeter College – the outstanding Further Education College in Devon. You have a total of 462 courses – some which I tried this morning – from particle physics to cake decorating. And you offer your students an extraordinary chance to skill themselves in everything from football coaching to specialist Devon cookery, industrial robotics, heavy vehicle manufacture and design. And I am thrilled that you offer philosophy, and languages, and even classical civilisation – but this is the home of the practical, the hands-on, disciplines that are not only academically and intellectually challenging but which are also of immediate practical usefulness and relevance to the world we live in. And I don’t just mean useful for individual jobs and livelihoods. All of us in this country need you to have those practical skills – we need those practical skills collectively, as a society and as an economy - more than ever. And so today I want to set out how this government will offer a Lifetime Skills Guarantee to help people train and retrain– at any stage in their lives – and enable us not just to come through this crisis, but to come back stronger, and build back better. Our economy has been shaken by COVID, and in the hand-to-mouth scrabblings of the pandemic the shortcomings of our labour market – and our educational system – have been painfully apparent. In the last few months I have been touring labs where people, many of them young, are working flat out on testing samples – testing for the disease, testing for the efficacy of potential vaccines, testing the tests. And it is hard work. It requires endless patience, and good hand-eye coordination. It also requires an excellent grounding in lab techniques and in the science – and every time I have been fascinated to find that a sizeable proportion of the technicians are from overseas. And though I welcome that, because it is one of the glories of our education system that it attracts so many people from around the world, we have to face the fact – that at this moment when we need them so much, there is a shortage of UK-trained lab technicians, just as there is a shortage of so many crucial skills. We are short of skilled construction workers, and skilled mechanics, and skilled engineers, and we are short of hundreds of thousands of IT experts. And it is not as though the market does not require these skills. The market will pay richly. The problem is one of supply – and somehow our post-18 educational system is not working in such a way as to endow people with those skills. And look I don’t for a second want to blame our universities. I love our universities, and it is one of this country’s great achievements massively to have expanded higher education. But we also need to recognise that a significant and growing minority of young people leave university and work in a non-graduate job, and end up wondering whether they did the right thing. Was it sensible to rack up that debt on that degree? Were they ever given the choice to look at the more practical options, the courses – just as stimulating - that lead more directly to well-paid jobs? We seem on the one hand to have too few of the right skills for the jobs our economy creates, and on the other hand too many graduates with degrees which don’t get them the jobs that they want. And the truth is we’re not giving anywhere near enough of the right kind of training or support to the fifty per cent of young people who don’t want to go to university, and so we’re depriving them of the chance to find their vocation and develop a fulfilling, well-paid career. And so the result is business isn’t happy; the economy is under-productive; and many working adults are stuck in jobs without much future when they are hungry for new opportunities. So it is time for change, and for radical change. Let us begin by admitting that part of the problem is that not every FE college is as superb as Exeter College. We need to invest in skills, and we need to invest in FE. That is why we are putting £1.5 billion into upgrading and improving colleges across the country, fixing the leaky ceilings, bringing forward £200 million this year. The facilities here are awesome. I tried them myself this morning. And improving all FE is part of our levelling up agenda to ensure that the same quality applies everywhere. And as everybody knows, you can’t acquire skills in the classroom alone. You need to learn on the job, to build up the muscle memory and not just the theoretical understanding. So I can announce today that we will be expanding apprenticeships, reforming the system so that unspent funds can be used more easily to support apprenticeships not just in big companies, but in the SMEs where there is so much potential for job creation. And we want many more of these apprenticeships to be portable – so you can take them from company to company. Suppose you are in a small start-up making videos for Youtube, and the project ends – so you’ve got to move to another such small company. Under our plans, you will be able to take that apprenticeship to your new employer and it won’t die with the end of the contract. But if we are going to reform our post-18 education, we must go much further. We’ve got to end the pointless, nonsensical gulf that has been fixed for generations – more than 100 years – between the so-called academic and the so-called practical varieties of education. It’s absurd to talk about skills in this limited way. Everything is ultimately a skill – a way of doing something faster, better, more efficiently, more accurately, more confidently, whether it is carving, or painting, or brick laying, or writing, or drawing, or mathematics, Greek philosophy; every single study can be improved not just by practice but by teaching. So now is the time to end this bogus distinction between FE and HE. We are going to change the funding model so that it is just as easy to get a student loan to do a year of electrical engineering at an FE college – or do two years of electrical engineering – as it is to get a loan to do a three year degree in Politics, Philosophy and Economics. The Augar review highlighted the complexity of the funding system, the bias that propels young people into universities and away from technical education. It is time to end that bias. We will give FE colleges access to the main student finance system, so that they are better able to compete with universities; not for every FE course, but for a specific list of valuable and mainly technical courses to be agreed with employers. And in the coming years, as part of our Lifetime Skills Guarantee, we will move to a system where every student will have a flexible lifelong loan entitlement to four years of post-18 education – and suddenly, with that four year entitlement, and with the same funding mechanism, you bring universities and FE closer together; you level up between them, and a new vista of choice opens up. I want every student with the aptitude and the desire to go to university to get the support they need, but I also want all young people to be given a real choice in life, and not to feel there is only one route to success. At the moment many young people feel they have to go for the degree option. They feel they have only one chance to study, and to borrow. They might as well go for the maximum, and get a degree. Under our plans you could go for a one-year technical qualification and launch yourself at life – or you could do that, and then go to university later on. You have the choice. And it will be easier for older people to borrow to do courses locally - and to study and train part-time – to acquire the skills that can transform their lives. And of course we need this nimbleness now, this flexibility to acquire new skills, because COVID has massively accelerated changes that were already happening in the UK economy, whether in retail or in restaurant chains. And while the government is building on our furlough scheme, And we’re devising ever more imaginative ways to safeguard jobs and livelihoods, including the Winter Economy Plan, which Rishi Sunak the Chancellor announced last week, Alas as Rishi said, we cannot save every job. But what we can do is give everybody, give people the skills to find and create new and better jobs. Of the workforce in 2030, ten years from now, the vast majority are already in jobs right now. But a huge number of them are going to have to change jobs – to change skills – and at the moment, if you’re over 23, the state provides virtually no free training to help you. In fact we have seen a haemorrhage, in the last 20 years, in adult education – a million fewer than there were. We are going to change that right now. We are expanding the digital boot camps – where you can learn IT, whatever your age, replicating our highly successful training camps in Manchester and Birmingham in four more locations. Above all, from next April, we will introduce a new funding promise. As part of our Lifetime Skills Guarantee, we will now fund technical courses for adults equivalent to A level, all of which teach skills that are highly in demand. They’ll give anyone who left school without an A-Level, or equivalent, the qualifications they need when they need them, when they need them, helping people to change jobs and find work in the burgeoning new sectors that this country is creating. So suppose you work in retail or hospitality, and you think you are going to need to find a new job. And before COVID people were already shopping more online, and already sending out for food. But the crisis has compressed that revolution. So let’s imagine that you are 30 years old, and you left school without A levels, and you are thinking you could find a job – you were in retail or hospitality – you could find a job in the wind farm sector in the north east, or in space technology in Newquay, or in construction here in Exeter, or retrofitting homes so as to reduce carbon. You might see a job for yourself on one of the vast engineering and infrastructure projects that this government is leading: a surveyor or a rail technician. You might want to work in adult care. Crucial sector for our country. You have a huge range of options – in theory – but you need that technical knowhow, you need that A-level equivalent qualification; and we will fund it. We will give you the skills you need. The British economy is in the process of huge and rapid change, driven by the internet and the possibilities of remote communication. But as old types of employment fall away, new opportunities are opening up with dizzying speed – vast new sectors in which this country already leads or can lead the world. And over the last few centuries there is no other country that has shown the same adaptability, the same ingenuity in matching the demands of new technology. But for the last few decades, alas, we have been hamstrung as a country by a lack of investment in infrastructure, in science, by our antiquated planning system and by our failures in technical education. And this Government is putting that right We’re making unprecedented investments in infrastructure - and doubling the investment in science and technology from £11 billion to £22 billion a year by 2024. We’re changing the planning rules so that it’s easier to provide homes for young families and for businesses to grow and invest. And we’re transforming the foundations of the skills system so everyone has the chance to train and retrain. And this combination of reforms will tackle the fundamental problems in our economy of productivity and growth helping the country to invent new industries and contribute to humanity’s great challenges, from fighting pandemics to achieving net zero carbon emissions. Above all, it will make this country, our United Kingdom richer and it will make our country fairer. So my message today is that at every stage in your life, this government will help you get the skills you need. Through our Lifetime Skills Guarantee, we’ll upgrade Further Education colleges across the country with huge capital investment; we’ll expand apprenticeships, making it easier to get a high quality apprenticeship, and connect them better to local employers who know where the jobs of the future are going to emerge; we’ll fund free technical courses for adults equivalent to A level, and extend our digital boot camps; we’ll expand and transform the funding system so it’s as easy to get a loan for a higher technical course as for a university degree, and we’ll enable FE colleges to access funding on the same terms as our most famous universities; and we’ll give everyone a flexible lifelong loan entitlement to four years of post-18 education — so adults will be able to retrain with high level technical courses, instead of being trapped in unemployment. And this long-term plan – learning from what has worked around the world – will finally enable our amazing country to close the gap with other countries that in this one respect have had – or thought they had – the edge on us when it comes to skills and technical education. They thought they had the edge on us for 100 years. Well we have the talent. We have the potential. All we need to do is give people the chance. And yes we face a once a century pandemic but now is the time to fix a problem that has plagued this country for decades. Now is the time to end the pointless, snooty, and frankly vacuous distinction between the practical and the academic. And now is the time to give everybody – with this Lifetime Skills Guarantee – give people of all ages the means and the confidence to switch and get the skills they need. And now is the time for all of us to begin to build back better."
"Boris Johnson","Welcoming historic agreements and working towards a two-state solution","29 September 2020","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/welcoming-historic-agreements-and-working-towards-a-two-state-solution","Thank you, Mr President, and thanks as always to Special Coordinator Mladenov for his words. Mr President, like others, I’d like to start today by expressing our sincere condolences following the death of His Highness the Amir of Kuwait. As Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said, the personal contribution His Highness made to regional stability, and humanitarian assistance, will long be remembered. Mr President, the United Kingdom has warmly welcomed the historic steps taken over the last two months, with the normalisation of relations between three great friends of the United Kingdom: Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Israel. These positive steps are already having an impact, such as direct flights from Israel to the UAE and early commercial agreements. More positive progress will come: trade, cultural and scientific links and much more. We urge others across the region to follow the example of the UAE and Bahrain. Mr President, we must acknowledge that the agreements represent a profound shift in the region. It is critical that we as the international community build on the momentum of normalisation to take forward resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In his recent visit to Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab encouraged both the Israeli and Palestinian leaderships to use the suspension of annexation plans – plans the UK strongly opposed – as an opportunity. We urge the Palestinian Authority to resume co-operation with Israel, in the interests of the Palestinian people. We also call on both parties to make constructive and open steps towards a return to dialogue. Mr President, whilst the threat of annexation appears to have receded, the UK remains concerned by a number of negative trends on the ground. We reiterate our call on both sides to halt any activity that makes peace more difficult to achieve. In accordance with resolution 2334, this includes terrorism, incitement, violence against civilians, demolition of Palestinian property and settlement advancements. In Gaza, we welcome the agreement reached on the 31st of August, which has restored a degree of calm and led Israel to lift its ban on fuel and good imports through the Kerem Shalom crossing. On the 15th of September, Hamas once more launched rockets into Israel. We condemn these actions: they are unacceptable, unjustifiable and must stop. As ever, dialogue is the only way to address the situation. We remain concerned at ongoing plans to take forward settlements including in Givat Hamatos, Har Homa, and in E1. All settlements are illegal under International Law. Settlement construction in these highly sensitive areas would damage prospects for a two-state solution and threaten to further undermine the viability of a future Palestinian state with its capital in East Jerusalem. Despite the spread of COVID-19, 2020 is on course to be the worst year for Israeli demolition of Palestinian property since 2016. This includes donor-funded structures, paid for by Council Members and international partners. In all but the most exceptional of circumstances, demolitions are contrary to International Humanitarian Law. Mr President, we call on Israel to desist from such actions, and to provide a clear, transparent route to construction for Palestinians in Area C. We are also concerned about ongoing evictions of Palestinians from their homes in East Jerusalem. Israel, like all countries, has a legitimate right to self-defence, and the right to defend its citizens from attack. But in doing this it is vital that all actions are proportionate, in line with International Law, and are calibrated to avoid civilian casualties. For example, the shooting and injuring by the Israeli Defence Forces of an unarmed, deaf and mute Palestinian at the Qalandia checkpoint on the 17th of August is deeply concerning. The Israeli security forces must provide appropriate protection to the Palestinian people and be seen to conduct prompt, transparent investigations into claims of IDF misconduct. The Palestinian leadership must continue their efforts to tackle terror and incitement, to strengthen institutions and develop a sustainable economy. Hamas and other terrorist groups must permanently end their incitement and rocket fire against Israel. The United Kingdom Government strongly condemns all forms of violence and incitement to violence. We welcome Fatah and Hamas efforts towards reconciliation, and hope that this can lead to the holding of democratic elections across the Occupied Palestinian Territories. Mr President, let me end by reaffirming that the United Kingdom remains active on the Middle East Peace Process. We continue to work closely with international partners to advocate a two-state solution and encourage a return to meaningful negotiations. Thank you, Mr President."

I said that we faced the sad reality that on these figures we could expect many more daily deaths. And so that’s why we announced the package of restrictions and stronger enforcement last week. At the same time we’ve been intensifying the local lockdowns in areas where the disease has been flaring up. I want to say - I know how tough it is and has been for these communities and I want to pay a particular tribute to the students who are experiencing a first term back at university unlike anything they could have imagined. I can assure you, assure everybody at university, that plans are being put in place to allow students home safely for Christmas. I wish I could tell you tonight that the impact of this package has already begun to appear but it will take time to feed through. And yesterday we saw the biggest rise in daily cases since the pandemic began, today a further 7,108. We’ve also had a tragic increase in the number of daily deaths – with 71 yesterday and again today. And these figures show why our plan is so essential We now have to stick to it together - and we should stick to it with confidence, because there are many ways in which we are far better prepared than we were in March. We are on track to hit our target of being able to conduct 500,000 tests a day by the end of October, We’re already exceeding the number of tests per capita that are conducted in Germany, France and Spain. We have over 2,000 beds that could be available across seven Nightingale hospitals, and we will be able to go further if needed. We’ve ordered 32 billion items of PPE, and we’ll have a four month stockpile of masks, visors, gowns and other essentials for winter. By December, by the way, we expect UK manufacturers will meet 70 per cent of the demand for PPE compared with just one per cent before the pandemic. And in the last six months we have more than trebled the availability of mechanical ventilators to our NHS across the UK to 31,500. But the best way forwards, to protect the NHS, save lives, to keep our children in school and the economy moving, is to follow the rules wherever we live. So I want to thank everyone for the fantastic national effort that we are seeing, continuing to see And no matter how impatient we may be, how fed up we may become there is only one way of doing this, and that’s by showing a collective forbearance, common sense and willingness to make sacrifices for the safety of others. At this critical moment, when I know people will be wanting to know the details, I will be providing regular updates through these press conferences. And I have to be clear, that if the evidence requires it, we will not hesitate to take further measures that would, I’m afraid, be more costly than the ones we have put into effect now But if we put in the work together now, then we give ourselves the best possible chance of avoiding that outcome and avoiding further measures I know some people will think we should give up and let the virus take its course, despite the huge loss of life that would potentially entail. I have to say, I profoundly disagree. And I don’t think it’s what the British people want, I don’t think they want to throw in the sponge, they want to fight and defeat this virus and that is what we are going to do. Even as we fight Covid, it is vital that people get all the treatment they need for other conditions. But I must be clear, if the NHS were to be overwhelmed by covid, then no-one could get any such care. That’s why we must bear down on the virus now, so that we never reach that point, and I am absolutely confident that with ever increased testing, with better treatments and of course with the prospect of a vaccine, we will get through this. So let’s follow the rules, wash our hands, cover our faces, observe social distancing, download the app, as 14 million of you have already done, and together we will fight back against this virus, protect our NHS and save many more lives."

"Boris Johnson","Prime Minister's speech at the UN High-Level summit on biodiversity: 30 September 2020","30 September 2020","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/preserving-global-biodiversity","From the tiniest of plants to the mightiest, most majestic megafauna, the natural life that so enriches our planet today is declining at a pace that is truly terrifying. Almost 70 per cent of the world’s wildlife has been lost in the past half century – a lifetime to many of us but the blink of an eye in the grand sweep of planetary evolution. As many as one million species of plants and animals are threatened with extinction. We are on the brink of a world in which the orang-utan and the black rhino can be found not in the jungles of Borneo or the savannahs of Africa, but confined to the pages of a history book. And consider the pangolin – that scaly mammalian miracle of evolution boasting a prehensile tongue that is somehow attached to its pelvis. I don’t believe any of us would choose to bequeath a planet on which such a wonderfully bizarre little creature is as unfamiliar to future generations as dinosaurs and dodos are to us today. Yet that is what awaits us if we continue down this road. And that’s not just bad news for the pangolins, though it is a tragedy – it is bad news for all of us. Upset the delicate balance nature has achieved over tens of millions of years and the consequences could be catastrophic – for the economy, for the climate, for food security, for public health, for all the Sustainable Development Goals. Yet alongside the growing evidence of looming disaster I see growing evidence of a desire to avert it. There is the very fact of this summit, the first of its kind. The Leaders’ Pledge for Nature has been signed by the heads of many nations, including, I am proud to say, myself. And that’s not all the UK has been doing. At home we’re putting biodiversity targets into law; removing deforestation from our own supply chains; shifting our land use subsidies to support rather than damage nature. Internationally, we spearheaded the ambitious Global Ocean Alliance, committed to protecting at least 30 per cent of the world’s oceans by 2030. We’ve doubled our funding for International Climate Finance. We are launching a £500 million Blue Planet Fund to protect and restore marine ecosystems, and our Blue Belt programme is on track to protect marine areas the size of India. And of course as co-host of COP26 and president of next year’s G7 we are going to make sure the natural world stays right at the top of the global agenda. Because the rhinos and the pangolins and all the other threatened species and everyone who relies on that diversity of life, they need more than good intentions. They need concerted, co-ordinated, global action. Let this be the day that action begins. And let us leave the next generation a world every bit as diverse and wondrous as the one we inherited."
"Boris Johnson","Tackling COVID-19 together through the ACT-Accelerator: Foreign Secretary's statements","30 September 2020","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/tackling-covid-19-together-through-the-act-accelerator","Opening statement I’m delighted to be speaking here today from Vietnam to co-host this event with UN Secretary-General, Dr Tedros, South-African Health Minister Zweli Lawrence Mkhize, and we feel that the issue of equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines, treatments and tests is absolutely vital and urgent. As Secretary of State for the new Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office, we bring together both our diplomatic reach and expertise with our development, aid and experience to this vital agenda. Scientific cooperation has made breakthroughs at frankly record-breaking pace. With our enhanced collective knowledge, I think we’re in a much better position to tackle this terrible, invisible virus. In the UK, we are proud to play our part, supporting lifesaving treatments and backing up vaccine research with funding and investment. But new products will only have the influence that we need them to have, the impact on the pandemic, if they reach people who need them. So collaboration under the ACT-Accelerator is our best hope to bring the pandemic under control, and the UK is proud to support this initiative to drive equitable access and global impact through our funding. As my Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said, the health of every country depends on the whole world having access to safe and effective vaccines, wherever and whenever that breakthrough may occur. And the UK will do everything we can within our power to bring that about. We have actively engaged in the collaborative design of the COVAX facility, which is an unprecedented alliance of countries and partners pooling resources to accelerate vaccine development. We want to be able to ensure large-scale manufacturing, rapid delivery of the future vaccines globally and on an equitable basis. I’m very proud that the Prime Minister has announced the UK’s participation in the COVAX facility, which demonstrates our commitment to multilateral solutions to the global challenges that we all face. The pandemic is really an acid test of our international resolve to work together on the issue of the day, on the issue facing our generation, in order to save lives and rebuild our economies. We don’t just think it’s a moral responsibility, we see the direct national interest that we have and others have in protecting not just our citizens through vaccinating them, but preventing and isolating ourselves from a second global wave that would threaten us all. So we need to work together, we need others to join in that endeavour, and the UK has made a minimum commitment of £250 million and we will add an extra £1 for every $4 committed by others, up to an additional £250 million. Statements are important, but real collaboration is vital and we’ve got to back our aspirations with the resources necessary. The UK is living up to the responsibility we feel to ensure vaccines, treatments and tests are truly available to all and I call on the international community to step up so we can rise to this ground-breaking challenge together. Closing statement Thank you very much. I think we’ve seen from the various different contributions today the importance of the multilateral approaches to ensuring global access to new vaccines, treatments and testing. Collaboration is our best hope to bring the pandemic under control and our best hope to keep our economies and our societies open, which can ensure a genuinely collective economic recovery. I welcome the renewed commitments that have been made today. I welcome the discussions that we’ve had and all of the contributions that our participants have made. And I think as we look ahead to what will be a very busy autumn, we must use the commitments here today as the moment and the impetus for all of us to rise to the challenge and deliver the leadership and the investment that’s required to make a success of this enormous and daunting challenge. It’s only by working together that we can bring an end to the pandemic for everyone, everywhere. Thank you very much again."
"Boris Johnson","Prime Minister's video message for Black History Month: 1 October 2020","1 October 2020","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-video-message-for-black-history-month-1-october-2020","Prime Minister’s Black History Month message All this month, we’re celebrating the lives of black public servants who helped make the UK what it is. There are servicemen from the UK and Commonwealth who fought for and with Britain to defend democracy. Heroes like George Arthur Roberts. In the First World War he would literally pick up German bombs with his bare hands and throw them back over enemy lines; 20 years later he became a fire fighter, pulling Londoners from the rubble of the Blitz. There are women like Yvonne Conolly – who, in 1969, became the UK’s first black female head teacher. Throughout her 40-year career she inspired and mentored not only her young charges but also generations of educators. And of course there are the thousands of black nurses who came to the UK to staff the fledgling NHS – we see their legacy today in people like 2019 Nurse of the Year Tara Matare. Sadly, many of these individuals have not been recognised for their incredible contribution to this country. Far from receiving the respect and gratitude they deserved many black soldiers like George were actively shunned. Yvonne received so many threats that she needed to take a bodyguard with her to school. So this Black History Month let’s say thank you to figures from our past who we haven’t always thanked before. And let’s also reflect on where we are today. Whilst we have come a long way, and Britain is one of the most diverse and inclusive societies in the world, the events over the last few months have shown that there is still more work to be done. All too often we often forget that black history and British history are one and the same. And if we forget that, then we are left with a partial understanding not only of our past but also of our present. It makes it harder for young black people to root themselves and their experiences in our national life. And it makes it harder for all of us to understand where our country came from, the challenges it faces today, and what we can do to overcome them. And that’s among the reasons why I have established the Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities to examine where inequality exists across our society and to set out a positive agenda for change. Black history is our history – so let’s learn from it, and build a better future for us all."

Climate change and nature have taken centre stage at the UN General Assembly this year. This builds on last year’s UN Climate Action Summit, where the UK, Bangladesh, and others, launched the Call to Action on Adaptation and Resilience, strengthening support for vulnerable communities whilst building a resilient future for all people, environments, and economies. I am pleased to see the work the Climate Vulnerable Forum is doing, amplifying the voices of those most affected by climate change, and this call for countries to be more ambitious on mitigation, adaptation, and climate finance. UK and Bangladesh This event is testimony to Prime Minister Hasina’s enduring leadership on tackling climate change, both domestically and on the international stage. Bangladesh’s leadership on resilience was clearly demonstrated in the early warning and evacuation of millions of people from the path of super Cyclone Amphan (um-pan) in May. I was pleased Lord Goldsmith, UK Minister for the Environment, was able to pay a virtual visit to Bangladesh in August, where he observed Bangladesh’s work on adaptation and nature-based solutions. The opening last month of the regional office of the Global Centre on Adaptation in Dhaka further cements the role Bangladesh can play in sharing expertise across the region and accelerating progress. The UK, as COP26 President-elect, is committed to working with all countries and to joining forces with civil society, companies, and people on the frontline of climate change to inspire action ahead of COP26 next year. Climate change and COVID-19 As the world recovers from COVID-19, we must work together to ensure economic recoveries are green and resilient and support our shared objectives for the climate. In doing so, we must help those worst-affected by the double tragedy of COVID-19 and climate change to adapt and come back stronger. Coronavirus has provided a stark reminder of what happens when humanity’s relationship with nature breaks down. As we recover, we have an opportunity to protect and restore nature, reducing our exposure both to deadly viruses and climate impacts. The Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development are crucial frameworks for guiding the recovery. Climate finance Climate finance is a critical component of both the COP26 and the Paris Agreement. Securing the Paris temperature goals will require funding that favours low-carbon and resilient development. The UK has committed to doubling our International Climate Finance expenditure to at least $11.6 billion between 2021 and 2025, and we are asking other donor countries to match the scale of our ambition. We are eager to support climate-vulnerable countries in making a just transition to clean energy. This is critical to ensuring emissions are reduced in time to limit warming to 1.5 degrees. Ambition Summit This means that we need radical change. As Prime Minister Johnson announced in September, the UK, along with the UN Secretary-General, will host a virtual leader-level Ambition Summit on the 12th of December, the 5-year anniversary of the Paris Agreement. The Summit will provide a platform for leaders who are ready to come forward with greater ambition for adaptation; climate finance and mitigation through Nationally Determined Contributions; long-term strategies for getting to net zero; and new climate finance pledges and adaptation plans. We all have a role in increasing global momentum on climate action. Conclusion We owe it to current and future generations to base our recovery on solid foundations, including a fairer, greener, and more resilient global economy. On behalf of the United Kingdom, I thank Bangladesh and the CVF for their leadership on this journey. Together we can agree an ambitious, shared plan of action at COP26. The whole world is literally depending on us to make significant and faster progress. Thank you."
"Boris Johnson","Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 12 October 2020","12 October 2020","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-12-october-2020","Prime Minister’s statement on coronavirus on 12 October 2020 Good evening everyone. We are entering a new and crucial phase of our fight against Coronavirus. Because the number of cases has gone up four times in four weeks and it is once again spreading among the elderly and vulnerable. There are already more Covid patients in UK hospitals today than there were on 23 March when the whole country went into lockdown and deaths, alas, are also rising once again. These figures are flashing at us like dashboard warnings in a passenger jet. And we must act now. So we are giving local authorities across England around a billion pounds so they can protect vital services as they fight the virus. Nightingale Hospitals across the North of England are being prepared for service. And so we can squash this virus wherever it appears we are today simplifying, standardising and in some places toughening local rules in England by introducing three levels of Covid Alert. Medium, with existing national measures such as the Rule of Six and the closure of hospitality at 10pm. High, with extra measures including a ban on indoor social mixing between households or support bubbles. And Very High, for places where, without further action, the NHS will swiftly be under intolerable pressure. Areas within the Very High Alert category will be reviewed every four weeks and nowhere will be shut down indefinitely. And the exact restrictions at this level, Very High, will be worked out with local leaders, along with tailored packages of support. But at a minimum they will, sadly, include a ban on all social mixing between households in private places, including gardens and pubs and bars must close unless they can operate solely as a restaurant, serving alcohol only as part of a main meal. We will also ask people not to travel into and out of Very High alert level areas. Nobody affected by this will be left to fend for themselves. And we will expand our unprecedented economic support to assist those affected by these decisions, extending our Job Support Scheme to cover two-thirds of the wages of those in any business that is required to close, and providing those businesses with a cash grant of up to £3,000 a month, instead of £1500 every three weeks, and extra funding too for those in the Very High category for local test and trace and enforcement. You will shortly be able to type in your postcode into Gov.UK and see exactly what restrictions apply where you live. The majority of the country will, for now, be at medium. Most areas currently under local intervention will be at High, and Nottinghamshire, including Nottingham itself, East and West Cheshire and a small area of High Peak will also move to this level. Over the weekend we have been working with local leaders in areas where the data are most worrying. And from Wednesday, local authorities in the Liverpool City Region will move to the Very High alert level. In addition to pubs and bars we have agreed with Liverpool City mayor Steve Rotheram that gyms, leisure centres, betting shops, adult gaming centres and casinos will close. We are still working with other local leaders to determine how best to tackle the resurgence of the virus in their areas. But tackle it we will. No one, least of all me, wants to impose these kinds of erosions of our personal liberty, but I am as convinced as I have ever been that the British people have the resolve to beat this virus and that, together, we will do just that. With that I’ll hand over to the Chancellor, who has some more details on how we’ll be supporting these businesses, employees and areas affected by today’s changes."
"Boris Johnson","PM Commons statement on coronavirus: 12 October 2020","12 October 2020","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-commons-statement-on-coronavirus-12-october-2020","Mr Speaker, with your permission, I will make a statement on our continuing fight against coronavirus and how we intend to fulfil our simultaneous objectives saving lives, protecting the NHS while keeping our children in school and our economy running, and protecting jobs and livelihoods This morning the Deputy Chief Medical Officer set out the stark reality of the second wave of this virus the number of cases has quadrupled in the last three weeks there are now more people in hospital with Covid than when we went into lockdown on March 23 and deaths are already rising and of course there are those who say that on that logic we should go back into a full national lockdown of indefinite duration closing schools and businesses telling people again to stay at home as we did in March once again shuttering our lives and our society I do not believe that would be the right course, We would not only be depriving our children of their education we would do such damage to our economy as to erode our long term ability to fund the NHS and other crucial public services And on the other side of the argument there are those who think that the patience of the public is now exhausted and that we should abandon the fight against Covid stand aside, let nature take her course, and call a halt to these repressions of liberty and of course I understand those emotions I understand the frustration of those who have been chafing under the restrictions, the sacrifices they have made But if we were to follow that course Mr Speaker, and let the virus rip, then the bleak mathematics dictate that we would suffer not only an intolerable death toll from Covid, We would put such huge strain on our NHS, with an uncontrolled second spike that our doctors and nurses would be simply unable to devote themselves to the other treatments for cancer, for heart disease and hundreds more that have already been delayed and that would be delayed again with serious long term damage to the health of the nation and I am afraid it is no answer to say that we could let the virus take hold among the young and fit while shielding the elderly and vulnerable because the virus would then spread with such velocity in the general population that there would be no way of stopping it from spreading among the elderly and even if the virus is less lethal for the under 60s there will still be many younger people for whom, alas, it remains lethal So Mr Speaker, we don’t want to go back to another national lockdown We can’t let the virus rip and so we have followed since June a balanced approach with the support of many Members across the House to keeping the R down while keeping schools and the economy going and controlling the virus by changing our behaviour so as to restrict its spread That is why we have the Rule of Six, and why we have restrictions such as a 10pm closing time on our hospitality sector. Mr Speaker, I take no pleasure whatsoever in imposing restrictions on these businesses, many of which have gone to great lengths to reopen as safely as possible. Nor do I want to stop people enjoying themselves, but we must act to save lives. And the evidence shows that in changing our behaviour in restricting transmission between us our actions are saving lives. Left unchecked each person with the virus will infect on average between 2.7 and 3 others but SAGE assess that the current R nationally is between 1.2 and 1.5. So we are already suppressing that R to well below its natural level which is why the virus is not spreading as quickly as it did in March. But we need to go further. In recent months, we have worked with local leaders to counter local spikes with targeted restrictions. But this local approach has inevitably produced different sets of rules in different parts of the country that are now complex to understand and enforce. So just as we simplified our national rules with the Rule of Six, we will now simplify and standardise our local rules by introducing a three tiered system of local Covid Alert Levels in England - set at medium, high, and very high. The “medium” alert level, which will cover most of the country, and will consist of the current national measures. This includes the Rule of Six and the closure of hospitality at 10pm. The “high” alert level reflects the interventions in many local areas at the moment. This primarily aims to reduce household to household transmission, by preventing all mixing between different households or support bubbles indoors. In these areas, the Rule of Six will continue to apply outdoors, where it is harder for the virus to spread, in public spaces as well as private gardens. Most areas which are already subject to local restrictions will automatically move into the “high” alert level. As a result of rising infection rates, Nottinghamshire, East and West Cheshire and a small area of High Peak will also move into the “high” alert level. The “very high” alert level will apply where transmission rates are rising most rapidly and where the NHS could soon be under unbearable pressure without further restrictions. In these areas the government will set a baseline of prohibiting social mixing indoors and in private gardens and, I’m sorry to say, closing pubs and bars, We want to create the maximum possible local consensus behind this more severe local action, so in each area, we will work with local government leaders on the additional measures which should be taken. This could lead to further restrictions on the hospitality, leisure, entertainment or personal care sectors. But retail, schools and universities will remain open. As my Rt Hon Friend the Chancellor has set out, the government will expand its unprecedented economic support to assist those affected by these decisions, extending our Job Support Scheme to cover two-thirds of the wages of those in any business that is required to close, and providing those businesses with a cash grant of up to £3,000 a month, instead of £1500 every three weeks. We will also provide Local Authorities across England with around £1 billion of new financial support, on top of our £3.6 billion Towns Fund. And for very high areas, we will give further financial support for local test and trace, and local enforcement and assistance from the armed forces – not for enforcement but rather to support local services, if desired in the local area. Mr Speaker, I can report that we have been able to reach agreement with leaders in Merseyside. Local Authorities in the Liverpool City Region will move into the “very high” alert level from Wednesday. In addition to the baseline I have outlined, that is as well as pubs and bars, in Merseyside gyms and leisure centres, betting shops, adult gaming centres and casinos will also close. I would like to put on record my thanks to Steve Rotheram and his colleagues for their cooperation in very difficult circumstances. Engagement with other leaders in the North West, the North East and Yorkshire & Humber is continuing. I know how difficult this is – they like, like everyone in the House, us are grappling with very real dilemmas - but we cannot let the NHS fall over when lives are at stake. So let me repeat the offer that we are making to those local authorities – work with us on these difficult but necessary measures in the areas that are rated very high areas, in return for: more support for local test and trace more funding for local enforcement the offer of help from the armed services the job support scheme as announced by the Chancellor I believe not to act would be unforgivable, so I hope that rapid progress can be made in the coming days. Regulations for all three Covid local alert levels are being laid today. They will be debated and voted on tomorrow, before coming into force on Wednesday. We will also keep these measures under constant review, including a four-week sunset clause for interventions in “very high” areas. A postcode search on gov.uk, as well as the NHS Covid-19 app, will show which local alert level applies in each area and we are also publishing updated guidance to explain what the Covid alert levels mean for those who are clinically extremely vulnerable. And while these levels specifically apply to England, we continue work closely with the Devolved Administrations to tackle this virus across the whole of United Kingdom. Mr Speaker This is not how we want to live our lives, but this is the narrow path we have to tread between the social and economic trauma of a full lockdown and the massive human and indeed economic cost of an uncontained epidemic With local and regional and national government coming together in a shared responsibility and a shared effort to deliver ever better testing and tracing, ever more efficient enforcement of the rules and with ever improving therapies, with the mountains of PPE and the ventilators that we have stockpiled With all the lessons we have learned in the last few months we are becoming better and better at fighting this virus and though I must warn the House again that the weeks and months ahead will continue to be difficult and will test the mettle of this country I have no doubt at all that together we will succeed And I commend this statement to the House"
"Boris Johnson","PM statement on negotiations with the EU: 16 October 2020","15 October 2020","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-statement-on-brexit-negotiations-16-october-2020","Good morning, We left the EU on January 31 and delivered on the largest democratic mandate in the history of this country. And since then we have been in a transition period obeying EU law, paying our fees – as a non-voting member – working on the future relationship we hope to enjoy with our friends and partners from January. And from the outset we were totally clear that we wanted nothing more complicated than a Canada-style relationship, based on friendship and free trade. To judge by the latest EU summit in Brussels that won’t work for our EU partners. They want the continued ability to control our legislative freedom, our fisheries, in a way that is obviously unacceptable to an independent country. And since we have only ten weeks until the end of the transition period on January 1, I have to make a judgment about the likely outcome and to get us all ready. And given that they have refused to negotiate seriously for much of the last few months, and given that this summit appears explicitly to rule out a Canada-style deal, I have concluded that we should get ready for January 1 with arrangements that are more like Australia’s based on simple principles of global free trade. And we can do it, because we always knew that there would be change on January 1 whatever type of relationship we had. And so now is the time for our businesses to get ready, and for hauliers to get ready, and for travellers to get ready. And of course we are willing to discuss the practicalities with our friends where a lot of progress has already been made, by the way, on such issues as social security, and aviation, nuclear cooperation and so on. But for whatever reason it is clear from the summit that after 45 years of membership they are not willing – unless there is some fundamental change of approach – to offer this country the same terms as Canada. And so with high hearts and complete confidence we will prepare to embrace the alternative. And we will prosper mightily as an independent free trading nation, controlling our own borders, our fisheries, and setting our own laws. And in the meantime the government will be focussing on tackling COVID and building back better so that 2021 is a year of recovery and renewal. Thank you very much."
"Boris Johnson","Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 16 October 2020","16 October 2020","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-16-october-2020","Good afternoon, I am joined this afternoon by Dr Susan Hopkins of NHS Test and Trace and Public Health England and Sir Patrick Vallance Chief Scientific Advisor. On Monday, I explained that we would seek to consult with mayors and local authorities in areas moving into the Very High alert level. I am grateful to all those in local government in hotspot areas who have been working with us over the last week on how to control the virus in their areas. In particular, I would like to thank Steve Rotheram in Merseyside, Sadiq Khan in London and local leaders in Lancashire who have worked constructively with us. In Merseyside, where the situation is most acute, we were able to conclude talks quickly. In London, we have worked with the Mayor to respond to rising infections across the capital as well as particular spikes in some boroughs. And in Lancashire today, we have worked with both Labour and Conservative leaders to agree a package. These were tough discussions, difficult decisions. No one wants to have to implement these measures which damage local businesses, curtail individual freedom and impose significant strains on people’s mental health. But these decisions were necessary because of the rate of increase not just of infections but also in hospitalisations and admissions to intensive care. Without action, there is no doubt that our NHS would soon be struggling to treat the sheer number of people seriously ill with Covid. Non-Covid treatments and surgeries would need to be cancelled in order to cope. And many more people would die. So taking action is the right and responsible thing to do. And it is backed up by significant support for areas on Very High alert: The Job Support Scheme, combined with Universal Credit, means that those on low incomes who are affected by business closures will receive at least 80% of their wages. We are providing up to £465 million to help Very High alert level areas to implement and enforce the restrictions, in addition to the £1 billion of extra funding for local authorities across the country. We will work with local authorities to allocate testing and introduce local contact tracing. Now, we have not yet reached an agreement with Greater Manchester. I completely understand the reluctance of the Mayor and his colleagues to take Manchester into the Very High alert level. It is far from a pain-free course of action and it will mean a difficult time for the people of that great part of the country – on top of the restrictions they have already had to endure since the summer. But I must stress, the situation in Greater Manchester is grave, and it worsens with each passing day. Cases doubled in the last 9 days. High infection rates are creeping up the age range: while cases are 690 per 100,000 for 16-29 year olds, they have now risen to 224 per 100,000 for the over-60s. The number of COVID in-patients in Manchester’s ICU beds is already over 40% of the number at the height of the first wave. That number will inevitably rise further, given that hospitalisation occurs 2-3 weeks after infection. On present trends, in just over 2 weeks there will be more Covid patients in intensive care than at the peak of the first wave. So I urge the Mayor to reconsider and engage constructively. I cannot stress enough – time is of the essence. Each day that passes before action is taken means more people will go to hospital, more people will end up in intensive care, and tragically more people will die. Of course if agreement cannot be reached, I will need to intervene in order to protect Manchester’s hospitals and to save the lives of Manchester’s residents. But our efforts will be so much more effective if we work together. Some have argued that we should introduce a national lockdown instead of targeted local action and I disagree. Closing businesses in Cornwall, where transmission is low, will not cut transmission in Manchester. So while I cannot rule anything out, if at all possible I want to avoid another national lockdown, with the damaging health, economic and social effects it would have. Alongside our local strategy we have been working throughout to find other ways to suppress this virus. We are backing our brilliant scientists leading the global effort to find a safe and effective vaccine. We have also secured early access to over 350 million vaccine doses through a portfolio of promising new vaccines to ensure we are in the best place, and we are taking every possible step to ensure we can move as quickly as possible to deploy a vaccine if and when one is found to work. And we’ve created a huge diagnostics industry from scratch, scaling up the ability to test from 2,000 in February to more than 300,000 today. I also want to update on our future approach to testing. We are now testing more people than any other country in Europe but we always want to go further. One of the most dangerous aspects of this disease is that people without any symptoms can infect many others without realising it. If we can catch more asymptomatic people before they unknowingly pass on the disease to the vulnerable, we can help to stop the virus’ vicious spread. So far it has been difficult to do this. But that is changing. Scientists and companies in Britain and around the world have been developing new tests which are faster, simpler and cheaper. They have been working hard to discover and evaluate new testing technologies. Though there is work to do, It’s becoming clear over the past few weeks that some of these new tests are highly effective and can help us save lives and jobs over winter. We have already bought millions of these tests, some of which are very simple – meaning you simply need to wipe the swab inside your mouth – and can give a result as quickly as in 15 minutes. Some of these fast tests work with saliva and we are already using these in hospitals. We have started building the infrastructure for domestic manufacture of these tests, ensuring that Britain has the ability to produce millions of fast tests here. Over the next few weeks we will start distributing and trialling these tests across the country. This will enable us to do quick turnaround tests on NHS and care home staff much more frequently. By testing more frequently and quickly than ever before, we can hope we can help prevent the virus entering and spreading through care homes. And we will be able to test students in universities with outbreaks, as well as children in schools, helping us to keep education open safely through the winter. And we will make tests available to local directors of public health to help control localised outbreaks - handing more control from London to all parts of our country so that those on the ground can use the tools we give them as they think best. And I have instructed my team to ensure that Liverpool City Region, Lancashire, and any other areas which enter into the Very High alert level are immediately prioritised for those tests. This will make a big difference in how we protect people from this disease. But it’s vital that we all take a cautious approach to this new technology. First, it will take time to develop this plan. No country in the world is regularly testing millions of people, so we need to take the time to establish how to do this effectively and safely, and to build the logistics and distribution operation necessary for a large-scale operation across the country. Second, we won’t be able to use testing to get business back to normal quickly. In time, we want to use tests to open, and keep open, more parts of the economy that have sadly been closed. But it is crucial that we make sure such systems work safely and I must level with you that it will take time to get this right before many organisations can buy and operate these tests themselves. Third, this will need a huge effort across the country, and we will need hospitals, care homes schools, universities and other organisations to work with us as we develop this plan. But the most important thing is that people isolate if they test positive. If you test positive with one of these fast new tests, then you must stay at home. If everyone follows the rule and self-isolates if you have symptoms, get a positive test, or have come into contact with someone who has the virus, we will suppress the disease. And we must all remember that this virus thrives on human contact. So we must do everything in our power to limit its spread. Always think: Hands Face Space, ventilate your buildings, wear a face covering in enclosed spaces, keep your distance from others. And make sure - as I say - you improve ventilation when spending time indoors. If we all do these simple things we’ll protect each other from the virus and we will defeat it together. I’ll hand over to Patrick Valance who will run through the latest data and we’ll then go to your questions. Sir Patrick."
"Boris Johnson","Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 20 October 2020","20 October 2020","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-20-october-2020","PM statement at the coronavirus press conference on 20 October Good afternoon, Across the world, the countries most successful in their fight against coronavirus are adopting regional and local measures to protect their populations. That is why last week we launched the three Local COVID Alert Levels for England, with interventions based on the prevalence of the virus in local areas. Since then we have been undertaking discussions with local leaders in those parts of the country which are currently bearing the brunt of the second wave of this epidemic. Before I update you on those discussions, I will ask Jonathan Van-Tam to brief us on the latest data nationally and in Greater Manchester. Thank you very much JVT. That presentation you’ve just seen shows you clearly why we must act. Now I don’t want anyone to think their actions or efforts have been in vain. Our collective action, across the country, has brought the R number well below its natural rate of about 3. As a result, the virus is not spreading as quickly as it did in February and March. However, while the R is below its natural level, it does remain above 1, meaning the virus continues to spread. So, we need to take action to reduce the R and control the virus, especially in those parts of the country, as you’ve just seen, where the virus is most prevalent. This evening, informed by the data we have just seen, I can announce that Greater Manchester will move to the Very High alert level. This means that: Pubs and bars must close, unless they are serving substantial meals. Households can’t mix indoors or in most outdoor settings. In some public outdoor spaces, groups must be limited to the rule of six. And we strongly advise against travel into and out of the area. In line with the additional measures taken in Lancashire, casinos, bingo halls, betting shops, adult gaming centres and soft play areas must also close. Regulations will be laid in Parliament on Thursday and come into force just after midnight. I know that these restrictions are tough, both on businesses and individuals. And believe me no one wants to be putting these things into effect. But that is why we are putting in place a comprehensive package of support: The Job Support Scheme ensures those affected by business closures are still paid. And once you top that up with Universal Credit, those on low incomes will receive at least 80% of their normal income. We have made available up to £465 million to help local authorities implement and enforce restrictions. Greater Manchester will receive £22 million of this. And that’s on top of the extra £1 billion of extra funding we are providing for all local authorities across the country. We will work with local authorities to allocate testing and introduce local contact tracing. Over the last 10 days, we have sought to agree an approach with local leaders in Greater Manchester. Unfortunately, agreement wasn’t been reached. And I do regret this. As I said last week, we would have a better chance of defeating the virus if we work together. In addition I must say, to the support outlined above, we made a generous and extensive offer to support Manchester’s businesses. This offer was proportionate to the support we have given Merseyside and Lancashire, but the Mayor didn’t accept this unfortunately. And given the public health situation, I must now proceed with moving Greater Manchester, as I say, to the Very High alert level. Because not to act would put Manchester’s NHS, and the lives of many of Manchester’s residents, at risk. Despite the failure to reach an agreement, I hope the Mayor and council leaders in Greater Manchester will now work with us to implement these measures. Elsewhere, discussions on moving to the Very High alert level continue with local leaders in South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire and the North East. I hope and expect central and local government will continue to work closely together, as we are seeing in Merseyside, Lancashire, London and many other parts of the country. Because – ultimately – all of us want to protect the NHS, and in doing so to save lives."

The issue under consideration today is one of great importance. And as I start, let me just also say in response to Rob Malley, that I want to echo my German colleague on the case of Michael Kovrig, which causes us deep concern. Mr. President, the United Kingdom remains concerned by the trajectory of violence, instability and hostile state-activity in the Middle East and Gulf region. Heightened tensions and insecurity serve no one’s long term interest and instead put all at risk. We continue to call for de-escalation, dialogue and peace. The world cannot afford another conflict in the region. As we have said repeatedly in this chamber, our commitment to the JCPoA remains resolute and it is at the forefront of our policy to support regional stability. Iranian nuclear armament would have catastrophic implications for the security of the region and beyond, and the JCPoA is the only vehicle currently available to prevent this. Nevertheless, while we remain committed to the nuclear deal, systematic Iranian non-compliance with its JCPoA commitments is putting it at risk. Iran must engage constructively with the Dispute Resolution Mechanism and Iran must implement its commitments under the deal. This is critical for security across the Middle East. We have also frequently expressed our concern about Iran’s wider activity in the region. Iran has consistently carried out arms transfers to regional non-state actors in violation of Security Council resolutions. There can be no doubt that such proliferation destabilises the region and escalates already high tensions. That is why we regret the expiry of resolution 2231’s conventional arms restrictions. We will therefore continue to build our security cooperation with allies and partners and work to find a sustainable solution to Iranian proliferation. And we will redouble our efforts to ensure implementation of other Security Council resolutions, which prohibit arms transfers to regional non-state actors, including resolution 1546 in Iraq, resolution 1701 in Lebanon and resolution 2216 in Yemen. We will also ensure that the remaining provisions of resolution 2231, in particular the restrictions on Iran’s ballistic missile program, are rigorously enforced. Mr. President, for too long the region has been scarred by terrorism, war and other conflict. But though instability has increased, we must not lose hope. So we welcome the announcements of normalisation between Israel and the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, and we welcome the suspension of Israeli annexation plans. They must stay that way. The Abraham Accords demonstrate the potential for and the power of Jewish and Arab peoples in the region, breaking with the resentment and enmity of the past. Nelson Mandela once said, “resentment is like drinking poison and then hoping it will kill your enemies.” The antidote to resentment and enmity is reconciliation and as Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said, we hope that other states will follow the UAE and Bahrain’s example and thereby secure a more peaceful Middle East. So we must build on the momentum of the Abraham Accords in order to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which remains a wellspring for tension across the region. There is ultimately no substitute for direct talks between the Israelis and Palestinians towards the ultimate objective of a two state solution. Here, as with many of the region’s conflicts, mistrust can only be countered by measures to rebuild confidence and facilitate dialogue. Conflicts in Yemen, Syria and Iraq continue to be sources of instability in the region. On Syria, the United Kingdom continues to support an inclusive Syrian-led political process, as provided for in resolution 2254. Following the latest Constitutional Committee talks, we again implore all parties to engage properly with the process. A political settlement is the only way to bring long term stability to Yemen and to address the worsening humanitarian crisis. We fully support the peace process led by the UN Special Envoy and we urge all parties, particularly the Yemeni parties, to engage constructively. We remain committed to supporting a peaceful and prosperous Iraq, able to promote stability in the region. We are proud to work with Iraq within the global coalition to counter Daesh, a clear example of shared cooperation, effectively addressing one of the region’s biggest security concerns. Mr. President, we welcome the Secretary-General’s participation in this debate and the United Nations’ role working to resolve each of the aforementioned conflicts and sources of tension in the region. The Secretary-General can continue to rely on the United Kingdom’s full support in each theatre. However, as the concept note for today’s debate suggests, there is a need to look beyond current crises and to engage on wider issues. In the longer term this will require a process within the region, which includes confidence building measures leading to a wider dialogue. The United Nations has a potential role to play as a trusted mediator and indeed, OP8 of resolution 598 makes provision for the Secretary-General to examine, with states of the region, measures to enhance regional security and stability. And while we hope that today’s debate is a step in the right direction, we must be honest that an open debate in the Security Council, however well-intentioned, is not the forum for such conversations. Progress can only ultimately be made through candid conversations between all parties. We are also not convinced that launching into security focused working groups will result in meaningful dialogue. We must remain realistic about the current level of regional mistrust. The issues involved are complex and sensitive, and an incremental approach is needed to build confidence and cooperation. More critically, as Russia points out, any dialogue needs to be shaped by regional participants. I want to welcome the commitment to regional security expressed by Iran in its letter of the 15th of October to the Council covering the Hormuz Peace Endeavour. But as a party to conflicts across the region, Iran is not an impartial actor, and it would not be appropriate for any initiative to be Iranian-led. More consultation is needed within the region to avoid another failed regional security initiative. We should learn from the many failed attempts in order to make a future initiative a success. The Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe that led to the 1975 Helsinki Accords provide both positive and negative lessons, which we can draw on. Mr. President, in conclusion, it is vital that we hear from all regional states and we would welcome discussions beyond the Council that could help identify political and practical steps to reduce mistrust within the region. Such discussions could include a potential mediation role for the United Nations. As I said at the outset, tensions and insecurity in the region ultimately serve none. I thank the Russian Federation again for organising this debate on such an important issue. Thank you, Mr. President."

And I want to thank Rishi for measures that will protect people’s livelihoods and protect jobs and which will help us to deliver our overwhelming objective of getting the virus under control while keeping pupils in education and keeping the UK economy moving forward. I know that there are some people who will say that this economic objective is so important that we should stop all measures to control the virus and stop restrictions of any kind on our social lives or on the way we run our businesses. We can’t do that because alas the maths is inescapable. We would face many thousands more deaths. And no, to answer one commonly posed question, we would not be able to insulate the elderly and the vulnerable. Not in a society with so many multigenerational households. No country has been able to do that. And an uncontrolled expansion in the number of Covid patients would mean that the NHS would have even less capacity to treat heart patients and cancer patients and to deal with all our other medical needs. So that’s why we reject that extreme laissez-faire approach. And then there are others who say on the contrary that we need now to lock the whole place down from John O’ Groats to Lands’ End. Turn the lights out, shut up shop. Close schools and universities and go back to the same kind of lockdown we had in March and April and May. And I have to say I don’t believe that is the right course now. Not when the psychological cost of lockdown is well known to us and the economic cost. Not when it is being suggested that we might have to perform the same brutal lockdown again and again in the months ahead. And not when there is such obvious variation – unlike last time – between different parts of the country. So that’s why we are going for a balanced approach. A middle course between the Scylla of another national lockdown and the Charybdis of an uncontrolled virus. A regional and local approach - the same approach that is now being followed by some of the countries that are the most successful in their fights against the virus. And so to all those who are enduring these restrictions, and who have been enduring them for so long in all parts of the country. I want to repeat my thanks, for your bravery, for your patience and your public spiritedness. And I repeat – there are clear signs that our collective actions are working. Yes the R is above one, but thanks to the efforts of people of all ages in following the guidance and the rules the R is about half its natural rate. And if we follow the guidance together and follow the rules then we can get it down. And it is precisely because these measures are burdensome that from the beginning this government has provided unprecedented support to everyone in this country – support worth £200bn to look after jobs and livelihoods and business. And as we adjust our campaign to fight the virus it is right that we should now produce a new package of support across the country in addition to the specific agreements we have reached with Lancashire, Merseyside and others. And because it is far, far better to keep business going now rather than to let those jobs go forever in a new national lockdown. We will win this fight against Covid. Because we can see that treatments are getting better, and medicines are getting better and testing technologies are getting better. And we have shown before that we can drive the R down. And in the meantime we need to protect jobs, protect livelihoods, and put the UK in strongest position for an economic recovery. I am now going to hand over to the Chancellor Rishi Sunak."
"Boris Johnson","Girls' education: Baroness Sugg's speech at UNESCO’s Global Education Meeting","22 October 2020","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/baroness-sugg-speech-on-girls-education-at-unescos-global-education-meeting","I am pleased to join you all today on behalf of the UK Prime Minister, Boris Johnson. Global education is a top priority for the United Kingdom. I’d like to thank my fellow co-hosts, Norway and Ghana, and of course, UNESCO for convening so many of us today. In my remarks at the start of this extraordinary meeting on Tuesday I said that this is a crisis affecting every country. What has been clear in the discussions of the last 2 days is that there are particular challenges facing low-income countries and we need to come together to step up support. As has been highlighted by many contributors to this meeting, even before COVID-19 struck, we were facing a learning crisis. Hard-won improvements in access to education were not matched by improved quality. World Bank and UNESCO data suggested that globally, over half – 53% – of children could not read and understand a simple story by the age of 10. In low-income countries this figure was nearly 9 in 10 children. Projections now suggest that the global rate may have increased to 63%, driven by massive disruption that has affected over a billion children since the pandemic began. This is a tragedy for those children, but also for their communities and nations, as they risk missing out on the long-term health, economic, and social benefits that a quality education can secure. To avert this tragedy, UNESCO has asked us to ‘reimagine and recommit’ to education. ‘Reimagining’ education requires taking tough decisions to prioritise what we know is effective. Next week I am looking forward to launching the Global Evidence Panel on Education with World Bank colleagues. The Panel reflects the growing global consensus on what is effective in getting children learning – even more important as the economic and health pressures of COVID-19 begin to bite. For the UK, re-commitment starts with political leadership. All of us here today must work to elevate education as a core part of our COVID-19 responses. The UK believes that girls’ education should be central to this, and we will be standing up for the right of every girl to 12 years of quality education. Next year, this will be at the heart of our G7 Presidency, so the transformative power of girls’ education gets the political attention it deserves. ‘Re-Commitment’ also means proper resourcing. Throughout these first months of the pandemic, the UK has protected education support in our aid programmes. But more is needed. That is why next year, we will co-host the financing summit for the Global Partnership for Education with our good friends in the Government of Kenya. The Replenishment has a rolling financial target of $5 billion for the next 5 years. Yet even this won’t be enough on its own. We need innovative financial solutions to close the enormous financing gap, drawing in finance from additional sources, including the private sector. The GEM2020 Declaration recognises the challenge we face. I very much welcome the focus on the most marginalised, including girls, and the call to action on finance. I look forward to seeing the proposals from UNESCO to strengthen the SDG4 Steering Committee, which must help make our collective efforts all the more effective. We knew before COVID-19 hit that business as usual wouldn’t fix the learning crisis. It is now more important than ever that we raise our game, and come together in an effort to reduce the global learning gap. You can all count on the UK as a committed partner as we do so."
"Boris Johnson","Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 31 October 2020","31 October 2020","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-31-october-2020","Good evening and apologies for disturbing your Saturday evening with more news of Covid and I can assure you I wouldn’t do it unless it was absolutely necessary. First I will hand over to Chris and then Patrick who will present the latest data. Data Presentation Thank you very much Patrick, and Chris. I am afraid that no responsible PM can ignore the message of those figures. When I told you two weeks ago that we were pursuing a local and a regional approach to tackling this virus, I believed then and I still believe passionately that it was the right thing to do. Because we know the cost of these restrictions, the damage they do, the impact on jobs, and on livelihoods, and on people’s mental health. No one wants to be imposing these kinds of measures anywhere. We didn’t want to be shutting businesses, pubs and restaurants in one part of the country, where incidence was very low, when the vast bulk of infections were taking place elsewhere. Our hope was that by strong local action, strong local leadership, we could get the rates of infection down where the disease was surging, and address the problem thereby across the whole country. And I want to thank the millions of people who have been putting up with these restrictions in their areas for so long. I want to thank local leaders who have stepped up and local communities. Because as you can see from some of those charts, the R has been kept lower than it would otherwise have been, and there are signs that your work has been paying off And we will continue as far as we possibly can to adopt a pragmatic and local approach in the months ahead But as we’ve also seen from those charts, we’ve got to be humble in the face of nature And in this country alas as across much of Europe the virus is spreading even faster than the reasonable worst case scenario of our scientific advisers Whose models as you’ve just seen now suggest that unless we act we could see deaths in this country running at several thousand a day A peak of mortality alas far bigger than the one we saw in April Even in the South West, where incidence was so low, and still is so low, it is now clear that current projections mean they will run out of hospital capacity in a matter of weeks unless we act. And let me explain why the overrunning of the NHS would be a medical and moral disaster beyond the raw loss of life Because the huge exponential growth in the number of patients – by no means all of them elderly, by the way – would mean that doctors and nurses would be forced to choose which patients to treat Who would get oxygen and who wouldn’t Who would live and who would die, And doctors and nurses would be forced to choose between saving covid patients and non-covid patients And the sheer weight of covid demand would mean depriving tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of non-covid patients of the care they need It is crucial to grasp this that the general threat to public health comes not from focusing too much on covid, but from not focusing enough, from failing to get it under control And if we let the lines on those graphs grow in the way they could and in the way they’re projected to grow, then the risk is that for the first time in our lives, the NHS will not be there for us and for our families And even if I could now double capacity overnight – and obviously I am proud that we have massively increased capacity, we do have the Nightingales, we’ve got 13,000 more nurses now than last year, we have many more doctors – but it still would not be enough, because the virus is doubling faster than we could conceivably add capacity And so now is the time to take action because there is no alternative. From Thursday until the start of December, you must stay at home. You may only leave home for specific reasons, including: For education; For work, say if you cannot work from home; For exercise and recreation outdoors, with your household or on your own with one person from another household; For medical reasons, appointments and to escape injury or harm; To shop for food and essentials; And to provide care for vulnerable people, or as a volunteer. I’m afraid non-essential shops, leisure and entertainment venues will all be closed – though click and collect services can continue and essential shops will remain open, so there is no need to stock up. Pubs, bars, restaurants must close except for takeaway and delivery services. Workplaces should stay open where people can’t work from home – for example in the construction or manufacturing sectors. Single adult households can still form exclusive support bubbles with one other household, and children will still be able to move between homes if their parents are separated. If you are clinically vulnerable, or over the age of 60, you should be especially careful to follow the rules and minimise your contacts with others. I know how tough shielding was, and we will not ask people to shield again in the same way again. However we are asking those who are clinically extremely vulnerable to minimise their contact with others, and not to go to work if they are unable to work from home. I am under no illusions about how difficult this will be for businesses which have already had to endure hardship this year. I am truly, truly sorry for that. This is why we are also going to extend the furlough system through November. The furlough scheme was a success in the spring. It supported people and businesses in a critical time. We will not end it. We will extend it until December. There will be some differences compared to March. These measures above all will be time-limited, starting next Thursday 5 November. They will end on Wednesday 2 December, when we will seek to ease restrictions, going back into the tiered system on a local and regional basis according to the latest data and trends. Christmas is going to be different this year, very different, but it is my sincere hope and belief that by taking tough action now, we can allow families across the country to be together. My priority, our priority, remains keeping people in education - so childcare, early years settings, schools, colleges and universities will all remain open. Our senior clinicians still advise that school is the best place for children to be. We cannot let this virus damage our children’s futures even more than it has already. I urge parents to continue taking their children to school and I am extremely grateful to teachers across the country for their dedication in enabling schools to remain open. And it is vital that we will keep provision for non-Covid healthcare groups going. So please - this is really important - unless your clinicians tell you otherwise, you should continue to use the NHS, get your scans, turn up for your appointments and pick up your treatments. If at all possible, we want you to continue to access these services, now and through the winter. Indeed it’s only by taking this action that we can protect the NHS for you. On Monday I will set out our plans to parliament. On Wednesday, parliament will debate and vote on these measures which, if passed, will as I say come into force on Thursday. We have updated the devolved administrations on the action we are taking in England and stand ready to work with them on plans for Christmas and beyond. We should remember we are not alone in what we’re going through. Our friends in Belgium, France and Germany have had to take very similar action. So as we come together now to fight this second wave, I want to say something about the way ahead Because people will reasonably ask when will this all end And as I have said before I am optimistic that this will feel very different and better by the spring It is not just that we have ever better medicine and therapies, and the realistic hope of a vaccine in the first quarter of next year We now have the immediate prospect of using many millions of cheap, reliable and above all rapid turnaround tests Tests that you can use yourself to tell whether or not you are infectious and get the result within ten to 15 minutes And we know from trial across the country in schools and hospitals that we can use these tests not just to locate infectious people but to drive down the disease And so over the next few days and weeks, we plan a steady but massive expansion in the deployment of these quick turnaround tests Applying them in an ever-growing number of situations From helping women to have their partners with them in labour wards when they’re giving birth to testing whole towns and even whole cities The army has been brought in to work on the logistics and the programme will begin in a matter of days Working with local communities, local government, public health directors and organisations of all kinds to help people discover whether or not they are infectious, and then immediately to get them to self-isolate and to stop the spread And I can tell you tonight that the scientists may be unanimously gloomy about the immediate options But they are unanimously optimistic about the medium and the long term future We will get through this – but we must act now to contain this autumn surge We are not going back to the full-scale lockdown of March and April It is less prohibitive and less restrictive But from Thursday the basic message is the same Stay at home. Protect the NHS. And save lives."
"Boris Johnson","PM Commons statement on coronavirus: 2 November","2 November 2020","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-commons-statement-on-coronavirus-2-november","Mr Speaker with your permission, I will make a statement on the measures we must now take to contain the autumn surge of Coronavirus, protect our NHS and save lives. On Saturday evening the Chief Medical Officer and the Chief Scientific Adviser described the remorseless advance of this second wave. The extraordinary efforts being made by millions of people across the country especially by those in very high alert areas have made a real difference, suppressing the R rate below where it would otherwise have been. But the R is still above one in every part of England as it is across much of Europe and the virus is spreading even faster than the reasonable worst-case scenario. There are already more Covid patients in some hospitals now than at the height of the first wave, 2,000 more this Sunday than last Sunday. While the prevalence of the virus is worse in parts of the North, the doubling time in the South East and the Midlands is now faster than in the North West. Even in the South West, where incidence remains low, current projections mean they will start to run out of hospital capacity in a matter of weeks. And the modelling presented by our scientists suggests that without action, we could see up to twice as many deaths over the winter as we saw in the first wave. Faced with these latest figures, there is no alternative but to take further action at a national level. I believe it was right to try every possible option to get this virus under control at a local level, with strong local action and strong local leadership. And I reject any idea that we are somehow slower in taking measures than our European friends and partners. In fact, we are moving to national measures when the rate both of deaths and infections is lower than they were in France. We are engaged in a constant struggle to protect lives and livelihoods, and we must balance the restrictions we introduce against the long term scars they leave, whether for businesses and jobs, or our physical and mental health. No-one wants to impose measures unless absolutely essential, so it made sense to focus initially on the areas where the disease was surging and not to shut businesses, pubs and restaurants in parts of the country where incidence was low. I want to thank the millions who have put up with local restrictions, sometimes for months on end. I want to thank them, and to thank the local leaders who have understood the gravity of the position. And we will continue as far as possible to adopt a pragmatic and local approach in the months ahead. But we are fighting a disease Mr Speaker, and when the data changes course, we must change course too. To those in this House who believe we should resist further national measures, let me spell out the medical and moral disaster we face. If we allow our health system to be overwhelmed – exactly as the data now suggests – then that would not only be a disaster for thousands of Covid patients, because their survival rates would fall, we would also reach a point where the NHS was no longer there for everyone. The sick would be turned away because there was no room in our hospitals. That sacred principle - of care for anyone who needs it, whoever they are and whenever they need it – could be broken for the first time in our lives. Doctors and nurses could be forced to choose which patients to treat, who would live and who would die. And this existential threat to our NHS comes not from focusing too much on Coronavirus, but from not focusing enough. If we fail to get Coronavirus under control, it is the sheer weight of demand from Covid patients that would deprive others of the care they need. Cancer treatment, heart surgery, other life-saving procedures: all this could be put at risk if we do not get the virus under control. And even though we are so much better prepared than before, with stockpiles of PPE and ventilators, the Nightingales on standby, and 13,000 more nurses than last year, I am afraid the virus is doubling faster than we could ever conceivably add capacity. Even if we doubled capacity, the gain would be consumed in a single doubling of the virus. And so on Wednesday the House will vote on regulations which, if passed, will mean that from Thursday until 2nd December, in England, people will only be permitted to leave home for specific reasons, including: For education; For work, if you cannot work from home; For exercise and recreation outdoors, with your household or on your own, or with one person from another household or support bubble; For medical reasons, appointments and to escape injury and harm; To shop for food and essentials And to provide care for vulnerable people, or as a volunteer. Essential shops will remain open and click and collect services will continue, so people do not need to stock up. But I am afraid that non-essential shops, leisure and entertainment venues and the personal care sector will all be closed. Hospitality must close except for takeaway and delivery services. Places of worship can open for individual prayer, funerals and formal childcare but sadly not for services. However Remembrance Sunday events can go ahead, provided they are held outside, and observe social distancing. Workplaces should stay open where people can’t work from home – for example in construction or manufacturing. Elite sport will also be able to continue. Single adult households can still form exclusive support bubbles with one other household, and children will still be able to move between homes if their parents are separated. The clinically vulnerable and those over 60 should minimise their contact with others. And while we will not ask people to shield again in the same way, the clinically extremely vulnerable should only work from home. Mr Speaker, I am truly sorry for the anguish these measures will impose, particularly for businesses which had just got back on their feet, businesses across the country who have gone to such trouble to make themselves Covid secure, to install Perspex screens, to do the right thing. Each of these actions has helped to bring the R down, and their hard work and your hard work will stand them in good stead, but for now it is clear that we must do more together. So the government will continue to do everything possible to support jobs and livelihoods in the next four weeks as we have throughout. We have protected almost 10 million jobs with furlough, and we are now extending this scheme throughout November. We have already paid out £13.7 billion to help the self-employed, and I can announce today that for November we will double our support from 40 to 80 per cent of trading profits. My Rt Hon Friend the Chancellor will also extend the deadline for applications to Covid loan schemes from the end of this month to the end of next to ensure that small businesses can access additional loans if required. We are not going back to the full-scale lockdown of March and April, and there are ways in which these measures are less prohibitive. We have for instance a moral duty to keep schools open now that it is safe to do so, because we must not allow this virus to damage our children’s futures. So schools will remain open, as will colleges, universities, childcare and early years settings - and I am pleased this will command support Mr Speaker across the House. It is also vital that we continue provision for non-Covid healthcare so people should turn up to use the NHS, to get their scans, turn up for appointments and collect their treatments. Mr Speaker let me stress that these restrictions are time limited. After four weeks, on Wednesday 2nd December, they will expire and we intend to return to a tiered system on a local and regional basis according to the latest data and trends, and the House will have a vote to agree the way forward. We have updated the devolved administrations on the action we are taking in England and will continue to work with them on plans for Christmas and beyond. And while scientists are bleak in their predictions over the short-term, they are unanimously optimistic about the medium and long-term. And if the House asks me Mr Speaker what is the exit strategy, what is the way out – let me be as clear as I can: it is to get the R down now – to beat this autumn surge and to use this moment to exploit the medical and technical advances we are making to keep it low. We now have not only much better medication and the prospect of a vaccine the immediate prospect of many millions of cheap, reliable and rapid turnaround tests – with a result in minutes. Trials have already shown that we can help suppress the disease in hospitals, schools and universities by testing large numbers of NHS workers, children, teachers and students. These tests, crucially, identify people who are infectious but do not have symptoms, allowing them immediately to self-isolate and stop the spread of the disease, and allowing those who are not infectious to continue as normal. This means that, unlike in the spring, it’s possible to keep these institutions open and still stop the spread of the disease. And so over the next few days and weeks, we plan a steady but massive expansion in the deployment of these quick turnaround tests which we will be manufacturing in this country applying them in an ever-growing number of situations, from helping women to have their partners with them in labour wards when they’re giving birth, to testing whole towns and even cities. The army has been brought in to work on the logistics and the programme will begin in a matter of days. Mr Speaker, we have dexamethasone – the first validated life-saving treatment for the disease, pioneered in this country. We have the real prospect of a vaccine in the first quarter of next year and we have ever more sophisticated means of providing virtually instant tests. I believe that these technical developments, taken together, will enable us to defeat this virus by the spring, as humanity has defeated every other infectious disease. And I am not alone in this optimism but I cannot pretend that the way ahead is easy, or without painful choices for us all. And so for the next four weeks I must ask the people of this country to come together, to protect the NHS, and to save many thousands of lives. And Mr Speaker I commend this statement to the House."
"Boris Johnson","Prime Minister's statement to the House of Commons on coronavirus: 4 November 2020","4 November 2020","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-statement-to-the-house-of-commons-on-coronavirus-4-november-2020","Mr Speaker, I beg to move that these Regulations are approved and that we come together today to implement time-limited restrictions across England from midnight, so we can contain the Autumn surge of the virus, protect our NHS and save many lives. Of course, this not something that any of us wanted to do. None of us came into politics to tell people once again to shutter their shops, To furlough their staff, or stay away from their friends and family. And I feel the pain and anxiety that we all share in the month ahead. But as Prime Minister, when I am confronted with data that projects our NHS could even collapse, with deaths in this second wave potentially exceeding those of the first; and when I look at what is happening now amongst some of our continental friends and see doctors who have tested positive being ordered alas to work on covid wards, and patients airlifted to hospitals in some other countries simply to make space, I can reach only one conclusion: I am not prepared to take the risk with the lives of the British people. And I know, Mr Speaker, it might be tempting to think that because some progress has been made we just need to stay the course and see through our locally led approach. And it is true that the extraordinary efforts of millions across the country especially those in high and very high alert level areas – they have made a difference, Mr Speaker suppressing the R, the reproduction rate of the virus below where it would have otherwise have been And I want to record again my thanks again to the millions who have put up with local restrictions, and I want to thank the local leaders who have understood the gravity of the position. But I am sorry to say that the number of Covid patients in some hospitals is already higher than at the peak of the first wave. Even in the South West, which has so far had lower case rates than most of the rest of the country, hospital admissions are over half way to their first wave peak. SAGE’s latest analysis, published on Friday, suggests that the R remains above 1 in every part of England, which means the virus is continuing to grow among the population. And every day that the number is above one, is another day that the number of cases will rise locking in, more hospital admissions and alas more fatalities. and pushing the NHS ever closer to the moment when it cannot cope. The course we have before us is to prevent the R from going back remaining above one and to get it down. Otherwise we face a bleak and an uncertain future of steadily rising infections and admissions until as I say the capacity of the NHS is breached. And I know there has been some debate about the projections from some of these models, for example, exactly how big the loss of life might be, or the precise point at which the NHS might be overwhelmed, but all the scientific experts that I have talked to are unanimous on one point As the Chief Medical Officer has said – “if we did not act now, then the chance of the NHS being in extraordinary trouble in December would be very, very high.” And be in no doubt Mr Speaker what that means for our country and for our society. It means that the precious principle - of care for everyone who needs it, whoever they are and whenever they need it – that principal could be shattered for the first time in our experience It means those who are sick and suffering and in need of help - could be turned away because there was no room in our hospitals Mr Speaker even in East Sussex Mr Speaker. Doctors and nurses could be forced to make impossible choices about which patients would live and would die, who would get oxygen and who couldn’t. And I know that there are some Members like my honourable friend who are hearing from their local hospitals that the pressure is not that great yet. But the whole point about a National Health Service, is that when hospitals in one part of the country are over-run, sick patients are transferred to another, until the whole system falls over. And let me be clear this existential threat to our NHS comes not from focusing too much on Coronavirus, as is sometimes asserted but from not focusing enough. Because if we fail to get Coronavirus under control, it is the sheer weight of demand from Covid patients that would not only lead to the covid casualties that I’ve described but which would deprive other patients of the care they need. We simply cannot reach the point where our National Health Service is no longer there for everyone. And Mr Speaker this fate is not inevitable. We are moving to these national measures here when the rate both of deaths and infections is lower than they were for instance in France, when President Macron took similar steps. If we act now and act decisively we can stem the rising waters before our defences are breached. And this approach, these regulations I do believe are the way we can do that. Mr Speaker, I know there are many in the House who are concerned about how long these measures might last, and that if people vote for these regulations today, they could suddenly find that we are trapped with these national measures for months on end. So let me level with the House. Of course, I cannot say exactly where the epidemiology will be by 2nd December, But what I can say is that the national measures – that I hope the House will vote on tonight - are time-limited. It is not that we choose to stop them. They legally expire. So whatever we decide to do from 2nd December will require a fresh mandate and a fresh vote from this House. And as I have made clear, it is my express intent that we should return to a tiered system on a local and a regional basis according to the latest data and trends. Mr Speaker, the whole House will share my sorrow and regret at the necessity of these measures, particularly for businesses who had just got back on their feet Mr Speaker, who had done their level best to make themselves Covid-secure, installing handwashing stations, plexiglass screens, one-way systems And as the Chancellor has set out, we will do whatever it takes to support them. We have protected almost 10 million jobs with furlough, and we are now extending this scheme throughout November. We have already paid out £13 billion to help support the self-employed, and we are now doubling our support from 40 to 80 per cent of trading profits for the self-employed for this month. We’re providing cash grants of up to £3,000 per month for businesses who are closed - worth over £1 billion a month and benefiting over 600,000 business premises. We are giving funding of £1.1 billion to Local Authorities in England, to further support businesses and their local economy in the winter months. And this comes on top of the more than £200 billion we’ve provided since March. And we will also ensure that throughout this period that our schools stay open. We will not allow this virus to do any further damage to the future of our children. I said in the Summer we had a moral duty to reopen our schools as soon as it was safe to do so and that they would be the last element of society to close down again. And we have stuck to that pledge Mr Speaker Our schools will remain open, as will colleges, universities, childcare and early years settings. Mr Speaker, the measures before the House are designed to arrest the virus, to drive it down and to get on top of it once and for all. If we are able to test on a big enough scale to identify the people who are infected – often without symptoms and who unwittingly, asymptomatically pass the virus to others then those people will be helped immediately – this is the key thing - to self-isolate and break the chains of transmission, and reducing the spread of the virus –reducing the number of people in hospital, reducing the number of people dying. I think that if we all play our part in this system it could be a hugely valuable weapon in our fight against Covid in the short medium and long term, and an alternative to the blanket restrictions that have been imposed in so many parts of the world. We are piloting this week a mass test in Liverpool, where an immense effort benefiting from the logistical skill of the armed services will offer everyone a test. And our aim is to make mass and repeated testing available for everyone across the country. Thanks to the pioneering work of British scientists, we already have a life-saving treatment for Covid and the genuine possibility of a safe and effective vaccine next year. Taken together, these achievements provide every reason for confidence that our country can and will pull through this crisis and that our ingenuity will prove equal to the challenge. Mr Speaker, this year I and the whole government has asked much of the British people. More than any Prime Minister I believe has asked of the British people in peacetime. And I have to say that the public have responded magnificently and selflessly. Putting their lives on hold, bearing any burden, overcoming every obstacle and tolerating every disruption and inconvenience no matter how large or small or inconsistent Mr Speaker so that they can do the right thing by their fellow citizens. I wish that it had been enough to defeat this Autumn surge. But while I am more optimistic now, more optimistic about the medium and long-term future than I have been for many months, there can be no doubt that the situation before us today is grave, and the need for action acute. It is absolutely right for this House – for members on all sides of this House- to have the doubts that have been expressed, to seek answers from me and to provide scrutiny. That is the purpose and duty of the House of Commons. But, while it pains me to call for such restrictions on lives, liberty and business, I have no doubt that these restrictions represent the best and safest path for our country, our people and our economy. So now is the time for us to put our differences aside and focus on the next four weeks, getting this virus back to its box. And I know that, once again, our amazing country will respond to adversity by doing what is right – staying at home, protecting the NHS, and saving lives. And in that spirit, I commend these regulations to the House."
"Boris Johnson","Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 5 November 2020","5 November 2020","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-5-november-2020","PM statement on coronavirus 5 November 2020 Good evening everyone, Across the whole United Kingdom, people are engaged in a huge joint effort to put the coronavirus back in its box. Throughout the pandemic, this government has done whatever it takes to protect lives and livelihoods – in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. We have put in place an unprecedented package of economic support, protecting the wages and jobs of millions of people. We have built the largest testing capacity in Europe, with 32 million tests conducted so far and over half a million tests now available every day across the UK. We have ensured that, as we head into winter, the NHS has at its disposal over 30,000 ventilators and billions of items of Personal Protective Equipment, most of it now manufactured here in the UK. Across the whole of the UK, we have a shared goal – to suppress the virus, ensure the NHS is not overwhelmed, and in doing so to save lives. The UK Government and the devolved administrations are working together on a joint approach to the Christmas period, because all of us want to ensure families can come together wherever they live. The challenges we face are significant across the U.K. The average number of new cases each day is now 22,398, that’s up from 9,716 a month earlier. There are now 12,320 patients in hospital, up from 2,602 a month earlier. 1,142 patients are now in mechanical ventilation beds, up from 369 a month earlier. Sadly 492 deaths were reported yesterday. The weekly average number of deaths each day is now 295, up from 53 a month earlier. That’s why new restrictions are in place in each part of the UK. In England, from today, we are once again asking you to stay at home. As I explained on Saturday you can only leave home for specific reasons: for work if you can’t work from home, for education, and for essential activities and emergencies. The full rules, all of the details, are available at gov.uk/coronavirus and on the NHS Covid-19 app – please log on to see what you can and can’t do. I know how tough this is: For staff in the NHS and care homes, who are facing a tough winter on the frontline. For families, who can’t meet in the way they would want to. For businesses, forced to shut just as you are getting back on their feet. I know many of you are anxious, weary and quite frankly fed up with the very mention of this virus But I want to assure you this is not a repeat of the spring. Schools, universities and nurseries are all staying open. And these measures though they are tough are time-limited. The advice I have received suggests that four weeks is enough for these measures to make a real impact. So these rules will expire, and on 2 December we plan to move back to a tiered approach. There is light at the end of the tunnel. We have better treatments and techniques to take care of those in hospital, thanks largely to the ingenuity of British scientists. Rapid testing is being rolled out on a massive scale – with city-wide testing starting tomorrow in Liverpool. I am hugely grateful to the people of Liverpool for their participation in this pilot. I hope that by working together, we can get that great city on top of the virus. More broadly, there is also the very real chance of safe and effective vaccines. So taking those things together, these scientific advances can show us the way ahead. And in the meantime, the government will continue to support people affected by these new restrictions. As you know, we have protected almost 10 million jobs through furlough, and as the Chancellor announced earlier today, we are now extending the scheme through to March. We are also extending our support for the self-employed, so that the next payment increases to 80 per cent of average profits. We’re providing cash grants for businesses who are closed, worth more than £1 billion every month. We are giving £1.1 billion to Local Authorities in England to support businesses. And a further £2 billion of funding is guaranteed for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. As we face these challenges together, we must look after those in most need. As of September we have helped over 29,000 rough sleepers off the streets, two thirds of whom are now in settled accommodation. Today we’re announcing a further £15 million to help councils offer safe accommodation for people who are sleeping rough or at risk of becoming homeless. This programme will help areas that need additional support most during the restrictions and throughout the winter. These are difficult times. And while it pains me to have to ask once again for so many to give up so much, I know that, together, we can get through this. So please, for the next four weeks, stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives. I’ll now hand over to the Head of NHS England Simon Stevens who’s going to talk about the NHS’s preparations for winter."
"Boris Johnson","Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 9 November 2020","9 November 2020","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-9-november-2020","PM statement on coronavirus 9 November 2020 Across the country and around the world this evening, people are asking one question about our fight against Covid, does the news of progress towards a vaccine – that’s been announced today - mean we are at the beginning of the end of our troubles? So, let me set out our assessment. The Pfizer/BioNTech Vaccine has been tested on over 40,000 volunteers and interim results suggest it is proving 90 per cent effective at protecting people against the virus. But we haven’t yet seen the full safety data, and these findings also need to be peer-reviewed. So we have cleared one significant hurdle but there are several more to go before we know the vaccine can be used. What I can say is that if and when this vaccine is approved, we, in this country, will be ready to start using it. Earlier this year the UK Government ordered 40 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine – enough for about a third of the population, since you need two doses each. That puts us towards the front of the international pack on a per capita basis – and I should add we’ve ordered over 300 million doses from 5 other vaccine candidates as well. If the Pfizer vaccine passes all the rigorous safety checks and is proved to be effective then we will begin a UK-wide NHS led programme of vaccine distribution. We will decide the order in which people are offered the vaccination taking account of recommendations from a group of scientific experts, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation. They’re looking at a range of factors, including the different characteristics of different types of vaccines, to work out the most effective way to protect as many people as possible and save as many lives as we can. And we will be setting out more detail about that in due course. But – and you know I am going to say this - I must stress, these are very, very early days. We have talked for a long time, or I have, about the distant bugle of the scientific cavalry coming over the brow of the hill And tonight that toot of the bugle is louder. But it is still some way off. And we absolutely cannot rely on this as a solution. The biggest mistake we could make now would be to slacken our resolve at such a critical moment. On Friday, SAGE reported that the R is above 1 in England – though this does not take into account the current national restrictions. Alas, the death figures are tragically rising, running at an average of over 300 a day – sadly double where they were 24 days ago The number of Covid patients in hospital has risen from just over 10,000 two weeks ago to nearly 13,000 on 5 November, and we are heading towards the levels of the previous peak. Irrespective of whether there is a vaccine on the way or not we must continue to do everything possible right now to bring the R down. And that is why we hope and believe that mass testing will help. Our first pilot began in Liverpool on Friday, in partnership with Liverpool City Council. We’ve tested thousands of people there but there are still a lot more to do, so please if you are in Liverpool, get yourself along to a testing centre – there are 19 at the moment with more still to come. The more people get tested the better we can protect that great city, and drive the disease down in Liverpool so do it for your friends, for your relatives, for your community. And I want to thank the fantastic support of the army, the people of Liverpool and Liverpool City Council. And we are now going further by sending out hundreds of thousands of rapid lateral flow tests to local authorities right across England - and also of course to the Devolved Administrations. We’re also working with universities to establish, as soon as possible, similar mass testing capacity for students up and down the country. But while we are making progress this project is still in its infancy. And neither mass testing nor progress on vaccines –both vital arrows in our epidemiological quiver, both key parts of our fight against Covid - are at the present time a substitute for the national restrictions, for social distancing, for hand hygiene and all the rest. So it is all the more important to follow the rules. I know it’s been a tough first weekend of these Autumn restrictions and I’m especially grateful to the Royal British Legion and all those who worked so hard to ensure that no virus would stop us yesterday from honouring the memory of those who gave their lives for our freedom. But we must get through this to 2nd December, when these measures expire and we plan to move forward with a tiered approach. Remember the basics, hands, face, space, and the follow the rules, that is how we can together protect our NHS, save lives and get this virus back in its box. And that is what we will do. So thank you. And I’m now going to hand over to Brigadier Fossey to talk about how the unrivalled logistical expertise of the British army that’s helping to deliver mass testing to Liverpool."
"Boris Johnson","The pivotal role of finance in tackling climate change","12 November 2020","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/the-pivotal-role-of-finance-in-tackling-climate-change","Good afternoon, it’s a pleasure to speak to you today. Governments and businesses around the world are continuing to respond to the immediate and acute challenges posed by the covid pandemic. But we know that the climate crisis has not taken any time off. We must ensure that the global recovery delivers a greener, more inclusive and more resilient future for all our peoples. One that delivers on the commitments of the Paris Agreement and meets the Sustainable Development Goals. I would like to congratulate President Macron and Secretary-General Guterres for their leadership in holding this event. The first ever global summit of public development banks. Finance has a pivotal role in tackling climate change. The IPCC estimate that limiting temperature rises to 1.5 degrees would require global energy investments of around $3.5 trillion a year until 2050. And public finance has a crucial role to play in stimulating private investment. Last year, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced a plan to double UK climate finance to £11.6bn over the period 2021-2025. And we call on others to match that ambition. The OECD has estimated that climate finance from developed countries reached 79 billion dollars in 2018, up 10 percent from the year before. And that bilateral and multilateral public finance has increased by 64 percent since 2013. This shows progress, but there is much further to go. Donors must meet and surpass the goal of mobilising $100 billion a year. And our COP26 Presidency will focus on working with others to mobilise funds and improve access for adaptation and resilience. Before COP26, we need to see all public development banks coming forward with clear plans. Including target dates by which their operations will be fully aligned with the Paris Agreement. The Finance in Common Summit Declaration will point the way forward for our work. Focusing on the green recovery and accelerating progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals. And on 12 December, the UK, the UN and France will co-host a Climate Ambition Summit, in partnership with Chile and Italy. And I invite leaders to use this as an opportunity to announce new commitments under the three pillars of the Paris Agreement; mitigation, adaptation and support. Working together, we can deliver the greener, more inclusive, more resilient future that we all want to see. Thank you."
"Boris Johnson","Prime Minister's article in the Financial Times: 18 November 2020","18 November 2020","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-article-in-the-financial-times-18-november-2020","Slowly but surely humanity is taking the upper hand in the fight against the virus. We have not won yet. There are still hard weeks and months to come. But with better drugs, testing and a range of vaccines, we know in our hearts that next year we will succeed. We will use science to rout the virus, and we must use the same extraordinary powers of invention to repair the economic damage from Covid-19, and to build back better. Now is the time to plan for a green recovery with high-skilled jobs that give people the satisfaction of knowing they are helping make the country cleaner, greener and more beautiful. Imagine Britain, when a Green Industrial Revolution has helped to level up the country. You cook breakfast using hydrogen power before getting in your electric car, having charged it overnight from batteries made in the Midlands. Around you the air is cleaner; trucks, trains, ships and planes run on hydrogen or synthetic fuel. British towns and regions — Teeside, Port Talbot, Merseyside and Mansfield — are now synonymous with green technology and jobs. This is where Britain’s ability to make hydrogen and capture carbon pioneered the decarbonisation of transport, industry and power. My 10 point plan to get there will mobilise £12bn of government investment, and potentially three times as much from the private sector, to create and support up to 250,000 green jobs. There will be electric vehicle technicians in the Midlands, construction and installation workers in the North East and Wales, specialists in advanced fuels in the North West, agroforestry practitioners in Scotland, and grid system installers everywhere. And we will help people train for these new green jobs through our Lifetime Skills Guarantee. This 10 point plan will turn the UK into the world’s number one centre for green technology and finance, creating the foundations for decades of economic growth. One — we will make the UK the Saudi Arabia of wind with enough offshore capacity to power every home by 2030. Two — we will turn water into energy with up to £500m of investment in hydrogen. Three — we will take forward our plans for new nuclear power, from large scale to small and advanced modular reactors. Four — we’ll invest more than £2.8bn in electric vehicles, lacing the land with charging points and creating long-lasting batteries in UK gigafactories. This will allow us to end the sale of new petrol and diesel cars and vans in 2030. However, we will allow the sale of hybrid cars and vans that can drive a significant distance with no carbon coming out of the tailpipe until 2035. Five — we will have cleaner public transport, including thousands of green buses and hundreds of miles of new cycle lanes. Six — we will strive to repeat the feat of Jack Alcock and Teddie Brown, who achieved the first nonstop transatlantic flight a century ago, with a zero emission plane. And we will do the same with ships. Seven — we will invest £1bn next year to make homes, schools and hospitals greener, and energy bills lower. Eight — we will establish a new world-leading industry in carbon capture and storage, backed by £1bn of government investment for clusters across the North, Wales and Scotland. Nine — we will harness nature’s ability to absorb carbon by planting 30,000 hectares of trees every year by 2025 and rewilding 30,000 football pitches worth of countryside. And ten, our £1bn energy innovation fund will help commercialise new low-carbon technologies, like the world’s first liquid air battery being developed in Trafford, and we will make the City of London the global centre for green finance through our sovereign bond, carbon offsets markets and disclosure requirements. This plan can be a global template for delivering net zero emissions in ways that creates jobs and preserve our lifestyles. On Wednesday I will meet UK businesses to discuss their contribution. We plan to provide clear timetables for the clean energy we will procure, details of the regulations we will change, and the carbon prices that we will put on emissions. I will establish Task Force Net Zero committed to reaching net zero by 2050, and through next year’s COP26 summit we will urge countries and companies around the world to join us in delivering net zero globally. Green and growth can go hand-in-hand. So let us meet the most enduring threat to our planet with one of the most innovative and ambitious programmes of job-creation we have known."
"Boris Johnson","PM statement to the House on the Integrated Review: 19 November 2020","19 November 2020","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-statement-to-the-house-on-the-integrated-review-19-november-2020","Mr Speaker, thank you and with permission, I will update the House on the Government’s Integrated Review of foreign, defence, security and development policy. Our Review will conclude early next year, setting out the UK’s international agenda, but I want to inform the House of its first outcome. For decades, British governments have trimmed and cheese-pared our defence budget and if we go on like this, we risk waking up to discover that our armed forces – the pride of Britain – have fallen below the minimum threshold of viability, and once lost, they could never be regained. That outcome would not only be craven, it would jeopardise the security of the British people, amounting to a dereliction of duty for any Prime Minister. So I refused to vindicate any pessimistic forecasters there have been by taking up the scalpel yet again. Based on our assessment of the international situation and our foreign policy goals, I have decided that the era of cutting our defence budget must end – and it ends now. I am increasing defence spending by £24.1 billion over the next four years, That’s £16.5 billion more than our manifesto commitment - raising it as a share of GDP to at least 2.2 percent, exceeding our NATO pledge, and investing £190 billion over the next four years, more than any other European country and more than any other NATO ally, except the United States. The Ministry of Defence has received a multi-year settlement because equipping our armed forces requires long term investment, and our national security in 20 years’ time will depend on decisions we take today. I have done this in the teeth of the pandemic, amid every other demand on our resources, because the defence of the realm, and the safety of the British people, must come first. I pay tribute to my Right Honourable Friends the Chancellor and Defence Secretary, who believe in this as fervently as I do. Reviving our armed forces is one pillar of the Government’s ambition to safeguard Britain’s interests and values by strengthening our global influence, and reinforcing our ability to join the United States and our other allies to defend free and open societies. The international situation is now more perilous and intensely competitive than at any time since the Cold War. Everything we do in this country – every job, every business, even how we shop and what we eat – depends on a basic minimum of global security. Our people are sustained by a web of lifelines, oxygen pipes that must be kept open open shipping lanes, a functioning internet, safe air corridors, reliable undersea cables, and tranquillity in distant straits. This pandemic has offered a taste of what happens when elemental requirements are suddenly in question. We could take all this for granted, ignore the threat of terrorism and the ambitions of hostile states, and hope for the best, and we might get away with it for a while, before calamity strikes, as it surely would. Or we could accept that our lifelines must be protected, but we are content to curl up in our island and leave the task to our friends. My starting point is that either of those options would be an abdication of the first duty of Government to defend our people. My choice – and I hope it will carry every member of this House – is that Britain must be true to our history, To stand alongside our allies, sharing the burden and bringing our expertise to bear on the world’s toughest problems. To achieve this, we need to upgrade our capabilities across the board. We have already united our international effort into a new department combining aid and diplomacy, Led with grit and purpose by my RH Friend the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Secretary. Next year will be a year of British leadership, when we preside over the G7, host COP-26 in Glasgow and celebrate the 75th anniversary of the first United Nations General Assembly in London. We are leading the world towards net zero with our ten-point plan for a Green Industrial Revolution, and we are campaigning for our values, particularly freedom of religion and the media, and giving every girl in the world access to 12 years of quality education. But extending British influence requires a once-in-a-generation modernisation of our armed forces, and now is the right time to press ahead because emerging technologies, visible on the horizon, will make the returns from defence investment infinitely greater. We have a chance to break free from the vicious circle, whereby we ordered ever-decreasing numbers of ever more expensive items of military hardware, squandering billions along the way. The latest advances will multiply the fighting power of every warship, aircraft and infantry unit many times over, and the prizes will go to the swiftest and most agile nations, not necessarily the biggest. We can achieve as much as British ingenuity and expertise allow. We will need to act speedily to remove or reduce less relevant capabilities – and this will allow our new investment to be focused on the technologies that will revolutionise warfare, forging our military assets into a single network designed to overcome the enemy. A soldier in hostile territory will be alerted to a distant ambush by sensors on satellites or drones, instantly transmitting a warning, using Artificial Intelligence to devise the optimal response, and offering an array of options, from summoning an air strike to ordering a swarm attack, by drones or paralysing the enemy with cyber weapons. New advances will surmount the old limits of logistics. Our warships and combat vehicles will carry “directed energy weapons”, destroying targets with inexhaustible lasers and for them the phrase “out of ammunition” will become redundant. Nations are racing to master this new doctrine of warfare and our investment is designed to place Britain among the winners. The returns will go far beyond our Armed Forces. From aerospace to autonomous vehicles, these technologies have a vast array of civilian applications, opening up new vistas of economic progress, creating 10,000 jobs every year – 40,000 in total - levelling up across our country and reinforcing our Union. We shall use our extra defence spending to restore Britain’s position as the foremost naval power in Europe, taking forward our plans for eight Type 26 and five Type 31 frigates, and support ships to supply our carriers. We are going to develop the next generation of warships, including multi-role research vessels and Type 32 frigates. And this will spur a renaissance of British shipbuilding across the UK – in Glasgow and Rosyth, Belfast, Appledore and Birkenhead – guaranteeing jobs and illuminating the benefits of the Union in the white light of the arc welder’s torch. If there was one policy which strengthens the UK in every possible sense, it is building more ships for the Royal Navy. Once both of our carriers are operational in 2023, the UK will have a Carrier Strike Group permanently available, routinely deployed globally and always ready to fight alongside NATO and other allies. Next year HMS Queen Elizabeth will lead a British and allied task group on our most ambitious deployment for two decades, encompassing the Mediterranean, the Indian Ocean and East Asia. We shall forward deploy more of our naval assets in the world’s most important regions, protecting the shipping lanes that supply our nation, and we shall press on with renewing our nuclear deterrent. We shall reshape our army for the age of networked warfare, allowing better equipped soldiers to deploy more quickly, and strengthening the ability of our Special Forces to operate covertly against our most sophisticated adversaries. Our security and intelligence agencies will continue to protect us around the clock from terrorism and new and evolving threats, We shall invest another £1.5 billion in military research and development, designed to master the new technologies of warfare, and we will establish a new centre dedicated to Artificial Intelligence and a new RAF Space Command, launching British satellites and our first rocket from Scotland in 2022. I can announce that we have established a National Cyber Force, combining our intelligence agencies and service personnel, which is already operating in cyberspace against terrorism, organised crime and hostile state activity. And the RAF will receive a new fighter system, harnessing Artificial Intelligence and drone technology to defeat any adversary in air-to-air combat. Our plans will safeguard hundreds of thousands of jobs in the defence industry, protecting livelihoods across the UK and keeping the British people safe. The defence of the realm is above party politics and we all take pride in how British resolve saved democracy in 1940, and British internationalism – directed by Clement Attlee - helped to create NATO and preserve peace through the Cold War. The wisdom and pragmatism of Margaret Thatcher found a path out of confrontation when she met Mikhail Gorbachev in 1984. In each case, Britain tipped the scales of history and did immense good for the world. Now we have a chance to follow in this great tradition, to end the era of retreat, transform our armed forces, bolster our global influence, unite and level up across our country, protect our people, and defend the free societies in which we fervently believe. Mr Speaker, I commend this statement to the House."

"Boris Johnson","PM statement on COVID-19 Winter Plan: 23 November 2020","23 November 2020","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-statement-on-covid-19-winter-plan-23-november-2020","Mr Speaker, thank you very much and with your permission, I will make a statement on the Government’s COVID-19 Winter Plan. For the first time since this wretched virus took hold, we can see a route out of the pandemic. The breakthroughs in treatment, in testing and vaccines mean that the scientific cavalry is now in sight and we know in our hearts that next year we will succeed. By the Spring, these advances should reduce the need for the restrictions we have endured in 2020 and make the whole concept of a Covid lockdown redundant. When that moment comes, it will have been made possible by the sacrifices of millions of people across the United Kingdom. I am acutely conscious that no other peacetime Prime Minister has asked so much of the British people and just as our country has risen to every previous trial, so it has responded this time, and I am deeply grateful. But the hard truth, Mr Speaker, is that we are not there yet. First we must get through Winter without the virus spreading out of control and squandering our hard-won gains, at exactly the time when the burden on the NHS is always greatest. Our Winter Plan is designed to carry us safely to Spring. In recent weeks, families and businesses in England have, once again, steadfastly observed nationwide restrictions and they have managed to slow the growth of new cases and ease the worst pressures on our NHS. I can therefore confirm that national restrictions in England will end on 2nd December, and they will not be renewed. From next Wednesday people will be able to leave their home for any purpose, and meet others in outdoor public spaces, subject to the Rule of Six. Collective worship, weddings and outdoor sports can resume, and shops, personal care, gyms and the wider leisure sector can reopen. But without sensible precautions, we would risk the virus escalating into a Winter or New Year surge. The incidence of the disease is, alas, still widespread in many areas, so we are not going to replace national measures with a free for all, the status quo ante Covid. We are going to go back instead to a regional tiered approach, applying the toughest measures where Covid is most prevalent. And while the previous local tiers did cut the R number, they were not quite enough to reduce it below 1, so the scientific advice, I am afraid, is that as we come out is that our tiers need to be made tougher. In particular, in tier 1 people should work from home wherever possible. In tier 2, alcohol may only be served in hospitality settings as part of a substantial meal. In tier 3, indoor entertainment, hotels and other accommodation will have to close, along with all forms of hospitality, except for delivery and takeaways. And I am very sorry obviously for the unavoidable hardship that this will cause to business owners who have already endured so much disruption this year. Mr Speaker, unlike the previous arrangements, tiers will now be a uniform set of rules, That’s to say we won’t have negotiations on additional measures with each region, it’s a uniform set of rules We have learnt from experience that there are some things we can do differently So from the 10pm closing time for hospitality we’re going to change that to so that it is last orders at 10 with closing at 11. In tiers 1 and 2, spectator sports and business events will be free to resume inside and outside - with capacity limits and social distancing – providing more consistency with indoor performances in theatres and concert halls. We will also strengthen the enforcement ability of Local Authorities, including specially trained officers and new powers to close down premises that pose a risk to public health. Later this week we will announce which areas will fall into which tier, I hope on Thursday, based on analysis of cases in all age groups, especially the over 60s, also looking at the rate by which cases are rising or falling, the percentage of those tested in a local population who have Covid, and the current and projected pressures on the NHS. I am sorry to say we expect that more regions will fall – at least temporarily – into higher levels than before, but by using these tougher tiers and by using rapid turnaround tests on an ever greater scale to drive R below 1 and keep it there, it should be possible for areas to move down the tiering scale to lower levels of restrictions. By maintaining the pressure on the virus, we can also enable people to see more of their family and friends over Christmas. Mr Speaker, I can’t say that Christmas will be normal this year, but in a period of adversity, time spent with loved ones is even more precious for people of all faiths and none. We all want some kind of Christmas, we need it, we certainly feel we deserve it. But what we don’t want is to throw caution to the winds and allow the virus to flare up again, forcing us all back into lockdown in January. So to allow families to come together, while minimising the risk, we are working with the Devolved Administrations on a special, time-limited Christmas dispensation, embracing the whole of the United Kingdom, and reflecting the ties of kinship across our islands. But this virus is obviously not going to grant us a Christmas truce, it doesn’t know it’s Christmas Mr Speaker and families will need to make a careful judgement about the risk of visiting elderly relatives. We will be publishing guidance for those who are clinically extremely vulnerable on how to manage the risks in each tier, as well as over Christmas. As we work to suppress the virus with these local tiers, two scientific breakthroughs will ultimately make these restrictions obsolete. As soon as a vaccine is approved, we will dispense it as quickly as possible. But given that this cannot be done immediately, we will simultaneously use rapid turnaround testing, the lateral flow testing that gives results within 30 minutes, to identify those without symptoms so they can isolate and avoid transmission. We are beginning to deploy these tests in our NHS and in care homes in England, so people will once again be able to hug and hold hands with loved ones, instead of waving at them through a window. By the end of the year, this will allow every care home resident to have two visitors, who can be tested twice a week. Care workers looking after people in their own homes will be offered weekly tests from today. And from next month, weekly tests will also be available to staff in prisons, food manufacturing, and those delivering and administering Covid vaccines. We are also using testing as the House knows to help schools and universities stay open, and testing will enable students to know they can go home safely for Christmas and indeed back from home to university. But there is another way of using these rapid tests, and that is to follow the example of Liverpool, where in the last two and a half weeks over 200,000 people have taken part in community testing, contributing to a very substantial fall in infections. So together with NHS Test and Trace and our fantastic Armed Forces, we will now launch a major community testing programme, offering all local authorities in tier 3 areas in England a six week surge of testing. The system is untried and there are of course many unknowns, but if it works, we should be able to offer those who test negative the prospect of fewer restrictions, for example, meeting up in certain places with others who have also tested negative. And those towns and regions which engage in community testing will have a much greater chance of easing the rules, the tiering, that they currently endure. Mr Speaker, we will also use daily testing to ease another restriction that has impinged on many lives. We will seek to end automatic isolation for close contacts of those found positive. Beginning in Liverpool later this week, contacts who are tested every day for a week will only need to isolate if they themselves test positive. If successful, this approach will be extended across the health system next month, and to the whole of England from January. And, of course, we are working with the Devolved Administrations to ensure that Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland also benefit as they should and will from these advances in rapid testing. But clearly the most hopeful advance of all is how vaccines are now edging ever closer to liberating us from the virus, demonstrating emphatically that this is not a pandemic without end. We can take heart from today’s news, which has the makings of a wonderful British scientific achievement. The vaccine developed with astonishing speed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca is now one of three capable of delivering a period of immunity. We don’t yet know when any will be ready and licensed, but we have ordered 100 million doses of the Oxford vaccine, and over 350 million in total, more than enough for everyone in the UK, the Crown Dependencies and the Overseas Territories. And the NHS is preparing a nationwide immunisation programme, ready next month, the like of which we have never witnessed. Mr Speaker, 2020 has been in many ways a tragic year when so many have lost loved ones and faced financial ruin. This will be still a hard Winter, Christmas cannot be normal, and there is a long road to Spring. But we have turned a corner: and the escape route is in sight. We must hold out against the virus until testing and vaccines come to our rescue and reduce the need for restrictions. Everyone can help speed up the arrival of that moment by continuing to follow the rules, getting tested and self-isolating when instructed, remembering hands, face and space, and pulling together for one final push to the Spring, when we have every reason to hope and believe that the achievements of our scientists will finally lift the shadow of the virus. Mr Speaker, I commend this Statement to the House."
"Boris Johnson","Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 26 November 2020","26 November 2020","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-26-november-2020","Prime Minister’s statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 26 November 2020 We now have reason to hope that by Spring, community testing and vaccines will combine to end this era of restrictions. But to get there we must first navigate a hard winter when the burden on our NHS is heaviest and the cold weather favours the virus. The data already suggests national measures in England have slowed - and in some places reversed - the growth of new cases. As more data comes in, we hope and expect to see those trends continue. Together we have prevented our NHS from being overwhelmed, but those dangers have not gone away. If we ease off now, we risk losing control of this virus all over again, casting aside our hard won gains, and forcing us back into a New Year national lockdown with all the damage that would mean. The tough measures in our Winter Plan are the best way to avoid this outcome. All our friends around the world are grappling with the same question of how to keep people safe without retreating into a winter of hibernation. In Italy there is a nightly curfew, in Germany, hospitality will remain closed until 20th December, and in France, until 20 January. Across the whole of the UK, measures remain in place to control the virus. Under our Winter Plan, England will return to a tiered system of local restrictions. Our decisions on which area enters which tier are based on public health advice according to five indicators: cases across all ages, especially the over 60s, the rate by which cases are rising or falling the percentage of those tested in a local population who have Covid and the pressure on the NHS. We are publishing data packs setting out the reasons behind decisions in each area. To find out how this affects you, log on to gov.uk where all the information is available. I’m sorry to confirm that, from Wednesday, most of England will be in the top two tiers with the toughest measures. I know this will bring a great deal of heartache and frustration, especially for our vital hospitality sector, our pubs, our restaurants, our hotels, in so many ways the soul of our communities - which continue to bear a disproportionate share of the burden. I really wish it were otherwise, but if we are to keep schools open – as we must - then our options in bearing down on the disease are necessarily limited. What we will do is continue taking every possible step to protect jobs and livelihoods across the UK. These tougher tiers strike a balance – they are sufficient to continue driving the virus downwards but it’s important to recognise they are less intrusive than the current national measures. In all tiers, shops, gyms and the leisure sector, hairdressers, other forms of personal care, places of worship will reopen. You will no longer be instructed to stay at home, though you should continue to work from home if you can. The rule of 6 will once again apply in public outdoor spaces and organised outdoor sport can begin again. But there is no doubt that the restrictions in all tiers are tough – and I am sorry about that. While the data is beginning to improve, the virus is still prevalent, and the faster we drive it down the faster we can lift restrictions. And that is exactly what these new tiers are designed to achieve. While the previous tiers slowed the spread of the virus, they were never quite enough to cut the R below 1 and keep it there, so areas did not escape whatever level they were placed in. Our new approach is designed to reduce R below 1, opening a path for areas to move down the scale, as soon as the situation improves. And crucially, we now have the means to accelerate that moment of escape with rapid community testing, allowing anyone carrying the disease - including those without symptoms – to isolate thereby reducing the R. And the truth is that at least one in three people with Covid have no symptoms at all and may be spreading the disease without even knowing that they’ve got it. The only way to identify them and protect everyone is through mass testing. Liverpool shows what can be achieved. In Liverpool, in the space of two and a half weeks, over 240,000 tests have been conducted and together with the effect of national restrictions, this has helped to reduce the number of cases in Liverpool City Region by more than two thirds. So having previously been in tier 3, Liverpool City Region and Warrington will now be in tier 2. This is a success story which we want other parts of the country to replicate so we will work with local government, public health leaders and our fantastic Armed Forces, to offer community testing to tier 3 areas as quickly as possible, opening the way for them to follow Liverpool’s example. Testing on this scale is untried, but in due course, if it works, where people test negative, it may also be possible for families and communities to be released from certain restrictions even if their home area stays in tier 3. The allocation of tiers will be reviewed every fourteen days, starting on 16 December. So your tier is not your destiny. Every area has the means of escape. And I have no doubt that together we can get through this Winter, suppress the virus until vaccines come to our aid, and then reclaim our lives and all the things that we love."
"Boris Johnson","Making the global green energy transition a reality","26 November 2020","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/making-the-global-green-energy-transition-a-reality","Thank you, Minister Singh for that introduction. Prime Minister Modi has often said that, “the world is one family”. There is no clearer example of this than climate change. No one nation or sector can tackle the problem alone. The world will succeed or fail as one. We all have a part to play: countries, companies, investors, cities, regions and individuals. To avoid the worst effects of climate change, we must decarbonise the global economy five times faster in the next ten years than we have done over the past twenty. We all know that the power sector accounts for a quarter of global emissions. Decarbonising is absolutely vital. Not only to reduce emissions. But to boost access to power, and to support clean growth and development. And this is why, as COP26 President, energy is one of five key areas that I am urging all countries to focus on. And there is no doubt for us that India is a key partner. Because, here, you are a global leader. With pioneering international initiatives like the International Solar Alliance. One Sun One World One Grid. The World Solar Bank. And the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure. Which the UK is very pleased to support. India is home to a renewable energy revolution. The scale and pace of change is absolutely remarkable. With solar capacity increasing around thirteen times in five years. And with some of the lowest solar prices in the world. You have already connected 700 million people to power since the year 2000. And thanks to Prime Minister Modi’s commitment to generate 450 gigawatts of renewable power within a decade. There will be much much more to come. It is our experience in the UK, that setting such targets provide investors with confidence and clarity. In the UK our emissions reduction targets have helped us to grow our economy by 75% over the last 30 years whilst at the same time reducing our emissions by 43%. And this has helped us to develop the world’s largest offshore wind sector. We will accelerate that success with Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s new plan for a Green Industrial Revolution, which we announced last week. And this includes a commitment to quadruple our offshore wind capacity within a decade, supporting many thousands of jobs . I know India has also enjoyed a surge of investment in renewables. This is vital. To make the global green energy transition a reality. We need investors to keep seizing the opportunities presented by the renewables revolution. In India and of course around the world. And these opportunities are enormous. A study by Imperial College London and the International Energy Agency found that investments in renewables have repeatedly outperformed those in fossil fuels: Over the past ten years, the past five years, and in 2020. Solar and wind are already cheaper than coal power in two thirds of countries. Momentum is building globally behind net zero. With China, Japan and South Korea all recently setting targets. Colleagues and friends will know And on 12th December, the UK will co-host a summit, with the UN and France, and our partners Italy and Chile, to mark the fifth anniversary of the Paris Agreement. This will be the moment for global leaders to show that we can make a step change on climate action. By focussing our efforts internationally, we can drive down costs and increase uptake. Every time the global deployment of solar power doubles, its price has fallen by around a third. That is why the UK is committed to working in partnership to drive the renewables revolution. We have established the COP26 Energy Transition Council. Bringing global leaders together. We work with India on Mission Innovation. Accelerating clean energy innovation globally. And we are partnering with the Government of India. To help mobilise private capital into its green investments. Our new UK-India Sustainable Finance Forum will increase the flow of sustainable finance. And we are both anchor investors in the Green Growth Equity fund. Catalysing private sector investments, through the City of London, to infrastructure projects in India. Through international partnerships like these. The insight of investors. And the ambition countries like India have shown. Together, we will continue to usher in the green global future of energy. Protecting our planet for future generations."
"Boris Johnson","Prime Minister's statement to the House of Commons on coronavirus regulations: 1 December 2020","1 December 2020","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-statement-to-the-house-of-commons-on-coronavirus-regulations-1-december-2020","Mr Speaker, I beg to move that these Regulations now be approved. And I want to begin by telling the House that I was hugely encouraged by a visit I paid only yesterday to a vaccine plant in North Wales where I saw for myself the vials of one of seven vaccines backed by the UK Government that could turn the tide of our struggle against Covid, not just in this country but around the world. It is the protection of those vaccines that could get our economies moving again, and allow us to reclaim our lives. And that one plant in Wrexham could produce 300 million doses a year and yesterday was the momentous day when it began to manufacture the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine. And it was a very moving moment Mr Speaker when I talked to one of the brilliant young scientists there, And she described the extraordinary moment for her in her life, to be part of an enterprise that was she thought truly going to offer humanity a route out of this suffering. But Mr Speaker, we have to be realistic, And we have to accept that this vaccine is not here yet, no vaccine is here yet and while all the signs are promising and almost every scientist I’ve talked to agrees that the breakthrough will surely come we do not yet have one that has gained regulatory approval. We can’t be completely sure when the moment will arrive and until then we cannot afford to relax, especially during the cold months of winter. The national measures which are now shortly ending in England have eased the burden on the NHS and begun to reverse the advance of the virus. Today, the R is back below 1 and the ONS survey is showing that signs of the infection rate are levelling off and Imperial College London has found that the number of people with Covid has fallen by a third in England since 2nd November. But while the virus has been contained, it has not been eradicated. The latest ONS figures suggest that out of every 85 people in England, one has Coronavirus; far more than in the Summer between 24th November and yesterday, 3,222 people across the UK lost their lives; and despite the immense progress of the last four weeks, our NHS remains under pressure, with hospitals in three regions – the South West, the North East and Yorkshire - all treating more Covid patients now than at the peak of the first wave. So we can’t simply allow the current restrictions to expire for the reason he gives with no replacement whatever. With the spread of the epidemic varying across the country, there remains a compelling case for regional tiers in England and indeed Mr Speaker a compelling necessity for regional tiers. But I hope the House is clear what I am not asking for today. This is not another lockdown, nor is this the renewal of the existing measures in England. The tiers that I am proposing would mean that from tomorrow everyone in England – including those in tier 3 – will be free to leave their homes for any reason. And when they do, they will find the shops open for Christmas, the hairdressers open, the nail bars open, gyms and leisure centres, swimming pools open, churches, synagogues, mosques and temples will be open for communal worship. Organised outdoor sport will resume, and in every tier you will be able to meet others in parks and in public gardens subject to the Rule of Six. And every one of those things has been by necessity restricted until today. Every one of them would be allowed again tomorrow. Of course I accept that this is not a return to normality. I wish it were so. But it is a bit closer to normality than the present restrictions. And what we cannot do is lift all of the restrictions at once, or move too quickly, in such a way that the virus would begin to spread rapidly again. That would be the surest way of endangering our NHS and forcing us into a new year lockdown, with all the costs that that would impose. We all accept that the burden on the hospitality sector has been very great. We feel this deeply, because our pubs, our hotels, restaurants they are in many ways the heart of the communities And part of the fabric of our identity as a country And everybody can see that the hospitality industry has borne a disproportionate share of the burden in this crisis. There’s no question about it. And that is obviously because we want to keep schools open Mr Speaker and we have to take such measures as we can. I would just remind the House however, that we are not alone in this. In France bars, restaurants and gyms will not reopen until 20th January at the earliest. In Germany, the hospitality sector will remain closed in its entirety over Christmas. But we will do everything in our power to support our hospitality sector throughout this crisis. We have already extended the furlough scheme for all businesses until the end of March, We’ve provided monthly grants of up to £3,000 for premises forced to close, and £2,100 for those that remain open but have suffered because of reduced demand. We have allocated £1.1 billion for local authorities to support businesses at particular risk. And today Mr Speaker we are going further with a one-off payment of £1,000 in December to wet pubs – that is Mr Speaker pubs that do not serve food as the House knows recognising how hard they have been hit by this virus in what is typically their busiest month. We will also work with the hospitality sector in supporting their bounce back next year. Mr Speaker I want to stress, that the situation is profoundly different now because there is an end in sight. And I am not this afternoon seeking open-ended measures. On the contrary, these regulations come with a sunset clause at the end of February, sorry at the end of the 2 February I should say Mr Speaker. At that point we will have sufficient data to assess our position after Christmas, and though I believe these types of restrictions will be needed until the Spring, they can only be extended beyond 2 February if this House votes for them Mr Speaker. These are points that have been made with great power as I say by Hon Members on all sides of the House. We will review the allocation of tiers every fourteen days, starting on 16th December. I just want to make an important point to my Rt Hon friend and to all members who are rightly concerned about the position of their constituencies, our constituencies, in these tiers. Hon Members have it in their powers, in our power to help move our areas down the tiers, by throwing their full weight Mr Speaker, our full weight as leaders in our communities behind community testing, and seizing the opportunity, seizing the opportunity to encourage as many people as possible to take part. Of the kind we’ve seen in Liverpool Mr Speaker where since the 6th November over 284,000 tests have been conducted, and together with the effect of national restrictions, the number of cases fell by more than two thirds. This is the model that I would recommend. We are now proposing that from tomorrow Liverpool City Region and Warrington should be in tier 2, where as previously obviously they were in tier 3. And we want other regions and other towns, cities, communities to follow this path, And that is why – with the help of our fantastic armed forces – we will be offering community testing to tier 3 areas as quickly as possible. Mr Speaker let me just say, I find it extraordinary that the Official Opposition –represented by the gentleman opposite - Currently have no view on the way ahead and are not proposing to vote tonight. I do think it is extraordinary that in spite of the barrage of criticism that we have no credible plan from the party opposite. Indeed, we have no view on the way ahead. It’s a quite extraordinary thing Mr Speaker that tonight to the best of my knowledge The RHG Opposite who has always said he will ‘act in the national interest’ has told his party to sit on its hands and to abstain in the vote tonight Mr Speaker. And I think the government has made its decision, we’ve taken some tough decisions Mr Speaker and the Labour opposition has decided tonight heroically to abstain Mr Speaker And I think when the history of this pandemic comes to be written, I think the people of this country will observe that instead of having politicians of all parties coming together in the national interest they had one party taking the decisions and another party heroically deciding to abstain Mr Speaker, in the story of 2020, I think there are two great feats in which we can take a great deal of comfort. First, our country has come together in an extraordinary effort that has so far succeeded in protecting our NHS and in saving many lives. And while our scientists have been zeroing in on the weaknesses of Covid, telescoping ten years of work into ten months, and now their endeavours are about to deliver the means as I say to rout the virus. That is clear. The Government is backing not one potential vaccine, but seven. We have ordered 100 million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, that is now seeking regulatory approval. We have ordered 7 million doses of the Moderna vaccine, which has almost 95 per cent effectiveness in trials. And Mr Speaker, we have ordered 40 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, which if approved by the regulator – could start being administered before Christmas. In total, Mr Speaker our Vaccines Task Force has secured more than 350 million doses, more than enough for everyone in the UK, the Crown Dependencies and our Overseas Territories. All we need to do now Mr Speaker is to hold our nerve until these vaccines are indeed in our grasp, and indeed being injected into our arms. So I say to the House again let us follow the guidance, let us roll out mass testing, let’s work to deliver mass testing to the people of our country, let’s work together to control the virus and it is in that spirit that I commend these regulations Mr Speaker I commend these regulations to the House."

Thanks to the fantastic work of Kate Bingham and the Vaccines Task Force, we purchased more than 350 million doses of seven different vaccine candidates, and the UK was the first country in the world to pre-order supplies of this Pfizer vaccine securing 40 million doses. Through our Winter Plan, the NHS has been preparing for the biggest programme of mass vaccination in the history of the UK. And that is going to begin next week, and in line with the advice of the independent Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation the first phase will include care home residents, health and care staff, the elderly and those who are clinically extremely vulnerable, But there are immense logistical challenges: the vaccine must be stored at minus 70 degrees and each person needs two injections, three weeks apart. So it will inevitably take some months before all the most vulnerable are protected, Long and cold months So it is all the more vital that as we celebrate this scientific achievement we are not carried away with over optimism Or fall into the naïve belief that the struggle is over Its not, we’ve got to stick to our Winter Plan, a comprehensive programme to suppress the virus, protect the NHS and the vulnerable, keep education and the economy going and use treatments, testing and vaccines to enable us to return to much closer to normal by spring. Today in England we have ended national restrictions, opening up significant parts of the economy in doing so; but also replacing them with tough tiers to keep this virus down. And I know that those tiers will mean continued hardship for many, and it is going to continue to be tough for some sectors but until the vaccine is deployed, our plan does rely on all of us continuing to make sacrifices to protect those we love. So please, please continue to follow the rules where you live, remember hands, face, space – and if you live in a tier 3 area where community testing will be made available, please take part in that community testing. Together, these steps are for now the surest way to protect yourselves and those you love and by reducing the transmission of the virus, help de-escalate your area to a lower level of restrictions, as vaccines and testing, as I say, take an ever larger share of the burden. And as we do all this, we are no longer resting on the mere hope that we can return to normal next year in the spring, but rather on the sure and certain knowledge that we will succeed: and together reclaim our lives and all the things about our lives that we love So I want to thank the scientists and all those around the world who have taken part in the trials and got us to this stage"
"Boris Johnson","Calling on all parts of society to increase climate ambition","2 December 2020","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/calling-on-all-parts-of-society-to-increase-climate-ambition","Thank you for that introduction, John. Very shortly after being appointed to my COP26 role, I visited the United Nations in New York to speak to Permanent Representatives alongside the Secretary General. And on this trip, one meeting struck a particular chord. It was an informal discussion with Permanent Representatives from developing nations, and we were going round the table, with everyone explaining what climate change meant for their country. And when we got to the representative from one of the small island developing states. She said quite simply ‘Unless we tackle climate change urgently, I won’t have a place to call home.’ Now for many people across the world, the situation is literally as stark as that. And that is why we need to work with the greatest urgency to tackle climate change. And ultimately this will require a joint effort on the part of governments, businesses, investors, cities, and regions working in partnership. To meet the goals of the Paris Agreement, we must decarbonise the global economy up to five times faster over the next 10 years than we have over the past 20 years. And that is why I am calling on all parts of society to increase their ambition, and to focus efforts on five critical areas: restoring nature, adaptation and resilience, clean energy, clean transport, and finance. Businesses realise that going green is not just the right thing to do, but it is also what their customers want, and increasingly what drives shareholder value. Analysis suggests, and many of you will know this, that investments in renewables create more jobs than the equivalent in coal, oil, and gas. Over the past decade we know that the cost of solar power has fallen by 85% and that of wind power by almost 50%. Both are now cheaper than new coal and gas plants in two-thirds of countries. And that is why the likes of ANZ, Commonwealth Bank, Westpac, and NAB – all major investors – have said they will stop investing in coal power. Globally, finance is also turning to clean sectors. Last month, for example, iron ore giant, Fortescue announced plans to build more than 235 gigawatts of renewable capacity. Our green global future creates enormous opportunities for countries and companies. And here in the United Kingdom we are seizing those opportunities. We have developed the world’s largest offshore wind sector, and we will accelerate that success with Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s new plan for a green industrial revolution, which was announced last month, and this includes a commitment to quadruple our offshore wind capacity within a decade, supporting many thousands of jobs. And in the UK, we’ve demonstrated that green growth is absolutely possible. Over the last 30 years, we’ve managed to grow our economy by 75%, and cut our emissions by 43%. In our experience, setting targets provides investors with confidence and clarity. We were the first major economy to legislate for net-zero emissions by 2050. And the momentum is now building behind similar targets around the world. Globally more than 120 countries have made carbon neutrality or net zero announcements. And this includes recent examples of targets from Japan, from South Korea, from China, and I urge all other countries to join them. On 12th December the UK, the UN and France will co-host a summit, in partnership with Italy and Chile, to mark the five-year anniversary of the Paris Agreement. And we are calling on leaders from across the world to use this moment to announce ambitious climate commitments. On emissions reductions, on climate finance, and on adaptation. And we need everyone to play their part. The Race to Zero campaign is a coalition of cities, regions, businesses, and investors which have committed, through science-based targets, to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 at the latest. They already collectively account for 50% of the world’s economy, and 25% of its emissions. And I would like to thank Australia’s States and Territories which have all made commitments to reach net-zero by 2050. And I urge all of you who have not already done so to join the Race to Zero Campaign. I also ask investors to sign up to disclose climate risk in line with the recommendations of the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures. This will become mandatory in the UK by 2025 and we need investors around the world to join us. The world we live in is changing. Growth is increasingly green. And by working together, we can bring about the change that we need, and ultimately help preserve our planet for future generations. Thank you."
"Boris Johnson","PM Climate Ambition Summit opening remarks: 12 December 2020","12 December 2020","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-climate-ambition-summit-opening-remarks-12-december-2020","Thank you very much Zeinab, thank you Secretary-General Antonio, thank you to my fellow leaders, excellences. Good afternoon from London, where we are coming to the end of an extraordinary and difficult year, I think with a sudden surge of scientific optimism. Because after barely 12 months of the pandemic, we’re seeing the vaccine going into the arms of the elderly and vulnerable, vaccines that have been products each and every one of them of vast international efforts in laboratories around the world. And so my message to you all, is that together we can use scientific advances to protect our entire planet, our biosphere against a challenge far worse, far more destructive even than coronavirus. By the promethean power of our invention we can begin to defend the earth against the disaster of global warming. And by that I mean that together we can reduce our emissions, we can radically cut our dependence on fossil fuels, we can change our agricultural practices, and in short we can reverse the process by which for centuries, humanity has been quilting our planet in a toxic tea-cosy of greenhouse gases. And at the same, we can create hundreds of thousands of jobs, millions of jobs across the planet as we collectively recover from coronavirus. If you doubt our ability to do that, let me tell you that when I was a child of six, this country depended on coal for 70% of our energy needs. That coal dependency is now down to 3% or less and since 1990, the UK has cut our CO2 emissions by 43% - more than any other G20 nation – and yet our economy has grown by 75%. Today, we’re putting our foot to the accelerator – in a carbon friendly way of course – with a Ten Point Plan for a Green Industrial Revolution. We want to turn the UK into the Saudi Arabia of wind power generation, enough wind power by 2030 to supply every single one of our homes with electricity. We’re going ahead with massive solar programme, even though we can’t hope to emulate the incredible things being done by India, Australia or Morocco for instance. Hydro of course - we’re liberating the awesome potential of hydrogen, whether for homes or all sorts of uses. On electric vehicles we’re going to ban ICEs, new internal combustion engines by 2030, with a very ambitious programme. We’ll continue to develop new nuclear power. We want to lengthen the lead of London, the UK, as the natural home of green finance. We want our homes to be emitting progressively less and less CO2 and doing more and more retrofitting of our homes. And wherever the UK may be accused of lagging, we won’t be lagging my friends in lagging. We want to encourage all modes of green transport, cycling, walking and so on. We want to use the relatively new miracle of carbon capture and storage actually to take carbon from power generation and industrial processes and bury it in under-sea caverns created by the extraction of hydrocarbons. And we’re now consecrating 30% of our waters, 30% of our land surface, to nature, because we think wild nature is the best way and most effective way of retaining carbon in a natural balance. We do all these things because they’re right for the world, they’re right for our country – but also because we know that this green industrial revolution will generate as I say hundreds of thousands of high skilled, high paying, good quality jobs for generations to come. And we’re going to help our friends around the world by moving away from supporting drilling and mining for hydrocarbons, but putting £11.6 billion of our overseas aid to support green technology and decarbonisation across the planet. We want to work with all of you on this call, on this conference – let’s do it together. Let’s make it our collective commitment, as Antonio has just said, to get to net zero by 2050. We in the UK, as he says, are going to do our bit, we’re reducing our emissions by 68% at least on 1990 levels over the next decade. And I’m really awed and humbled by the efforts of other countries around the world to set their own targets. And I just want to repeat that key message. We’re doing this not because we are hair shirt-wearing, tree-hugging, mung bean-munching eco freaks – though I’ve got nothing against any of those categories, mung beans are probably delicious. We’re doing it because we know that scientific advances will allow us collectively as humanity to save our planet and create millions of high skilled jobs as we recover from COVID. So thank you all very much for joining this conference, this Ambition Summit, thank you to Secretary General Antonio, thank you to my co-host Emmanuel Macron, who I know shares my keen interest in protecting the ecosystems of our seas and oceans, and I look forward to seeing you all in Glasgow face-to-face next year."
"Boris Johnson","Foreign Secretary's visit to India: joint press conference opening statement, 15 December 2020","15 December 2020","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/foreign-secretarys-statement-during-visit-to-india-tuesday-15-december","Good afternoon, thank you all for joining us and thank you Minister Jaishankar for your very warm welcome here in Delhi. Can I just start by saying what huge admiration I have for this country. You are the world’s largest democracy. The country with one of the highest number of scientists and engineers, a leader in tech, a leader in solar and wind energy, and a huge presence on the global stage. So it’s a great pleasure to be here with Dr Jaishankar and to discuss our shared plans for an even closer future relationship. We agreed on the key elements of a 10-year UK-India roadmap so that we can deliver a step change in ambition for the relationship between our two countries. We look forward to taking this forward in 2021 – including through the UK’s Presidency of the G7 and also our Presidency of the UN Climate Change Conference, and as we see and welcome India return to the UN Security Council. It is very much with that in mind I am pleased that Prime Minister Johnson has invited Prime Minister Modi to join the UK-hosted the G7 Summit next year. Prime Minister Johnson has also gratefully accepted the very generous invitation to attend India’s Republic Day celebration in January which is a great honour. I think we share the belief that we can do even more together on our shared priorities in the months and years ahead. For the UK, we see those priorities along the following lines. First of all, we want to deepen our economic partnership. We already have a strong and growing trade relationship. In the year before the pandemic hit, bilateral trade between India and the UK grew at a vibrant 11%. Our investment relations supports over half-a-million jobs in each other’s economies – including many UK jobs in tech and telecoms. Now what we want to do is take that up to another level working towards agreeing an enhanced trade partnership next year – which itself we hope will be a stepping stone towards a future Free Trade Agreement. I think that could unlock huge opportunities for British and Indian businesses, lowering barriers in areas like food and drink, healthcare and life sciences, IT, data, chemicals and financial services. I think there are some exciting possibilities ahead. Second, we are committed to building a stronger defence and security partnership with our Indian friends. That will help us to tackle shared issues of concern such as terrorism and maritime security – including piracy in the Western Indian Ocean. It will also help us respond to the new and emerging challenges like space and cybersecurity. We want to work together to ensure our telecoms networks, our 5G networks, are more secure and resilient. Third, climate change. Prime Minister Modi has been very clear this is a real priority for India. We recognise India’s global leadership in this area, through the International Solar Alliance and the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure. As hosts of the UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow next year, we will also be playing a leading role ourselves. We want to see an ambitious outcome which really helps to shift the dial on climate change. India has made real strides on renewable energy. We want to keep building on our partnership internationally in this area. Finally, I should also mention we want to deepen our partnerships in education, research and innovation. Our countries are both leaders in these fields. It is an area of complementarity, but also comparative advantage and I think there is a huge scope for further collaboration together in a collaborative international setting. In the UK we give a warm welcome to thousands of Indian students and academics in the UK each year. They make an incredible contribution to our country and we feel they are very valued guests and we prize the contribution they make. Perhaps the proudest example of our partnership today is on COVID-19. Oxford University, AstraZeneca and the Serum Institute India have been working closely together. And the Institute is now planning to produce one billion doses of the Oxford vaccine by the end of next year, many of which will be destined for low and middle income countries. That is the UK and India working together to transform people’s lives around the world. We want to take advantage of these vaccines, not only for our own people but to make sure the most vulnerable and poorest countries around the world get equitable distribution and access. In these areas, and many others, our partnership can be a force for good in the world at large. That’s why a closer relationship with India, and the wider Indo-Pacific region, is really one of the very highest policy priorities for the UK government. Thank you."
"Boris Johnson","Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 16 December 2020","16 December 2020","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-16-december-2020","Prime Minister’s statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 16 December 2020 It is just a week since the United Kingdom began the biggest vaccination programme in our history. And the public is coming forward at an extraordinary pace to get a jab, to protect themselves, beginning with the elderly and the most vulnerable. With 138,000 recipients of the first dose – and more joining them every minute - there is no doubt we are winning and we will win our long struggle against this virus which makes it all the more important that we hold our nerve this winter. Because we are now in a race to protect us all while doing everything we can to keep the virus under control. And thanks to the colossal collective effort in November we did bring the R below 1 we did get the infection rate down. But I must be frank with you we are already seeing worrying rises in some parts of the country: Kent is still seeing rising infections the number of cases in London is at 270 per 100,000 people. And that’s why we acted quickly by moving London into Tier 3 from today. And tomorrow the Health Secretary will announce the outcome of the latest tiering review. And so like every other European country facing similar challenges we have come to this moment, a great global festival a turning point, a time of year that is of immense emotional and spiritual importance. But also a moment for us to exercise extreme caution when we must remember that one of the most striking features of this virus is that it spreads invisibly from people who don’t even have symptoms which is in fact around 1 in 3 of everyone infected. And that’s why from the beginning this virus has been so hard to fight and that’s why it’s so important to follow the rules and why this Christmas it’s vital that everyone exercises the greatest possible personal responsibility. And having looked at the latest data – with our colleagues in the Devolved Administrations, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, we have decided that the overall situation is alas worse and more challenging than we had hoped when we first set the rules. So while it would not be right to criminalise people who have made plans and simply want to spend time with their loved ones, we are all collectively across the UK, governments at every level, asking you to think hard and in detail about the days ahead and whether you can do more to protect yourself and others. We are keeping the laws the same – but we all want to send the same message: a smaller Christmas is going to be a safer Christmas, and a shorter Christmas is a safer Christmas. When we say three households can meet on five days, I want to stress these are maximums, not targets to aim for. And of course it is always going to be safest to minimise the number of people you meet. And that means that if you are visiting others over Christmas, we are asking you – in the five days beforehand, as early as this Friday - to reduce the number of people you are in contact with to the lowest possible because this virus spreads from human contact. If possible don’t travel from a high prevalence to a low prevalence area and avoid staying away from home overnight if you can. Remember, the vaccine is on the way and our aim is to inoculate everyone who is clinically extremely vulnerable or elderly in the early months of next year. So if you’re elderly, the best way to minimise your personal risk is to wait to be vaccinated before spending time indoors with others. And if you have an elderly relative, you might want to delay seeing them until they’ve been vaccinated. And whatever your plans for Christmas, please think carefully about avoiding crowds in the Boxing Day Sales And no one should be gathering in large groups to see in the New Year – remember the rules in your local area will apply. In most places across the UK, I’m afraid that means you cannot mix with other households indoors. All the information about how best to protect yourself and your loved ones is being made available on gov.uk. So have yourselves a merry little Christmas And I’m afraid this year I do mean little But with the vaccine, and all the other measures that we are taking, We do know things will be better in this country by Easter And I’m sure that next year Christmas will be as normal for every family in the country."
"Boris Johnson","Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 19 December 2020","19 December 2020","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-19-december-2020","Good afternoon, I am sorry to report that the situation has deteriorated since I last spoke to you three days ago. Yesterday afternoon, I was briefed on the latest data showing the virus spreading more rapidly in London, the South East and the East of England than would be expected given the tough restrictions which are already in place. I also received an explanation for why the virus is spreading more rapidly in these areas. It appears this spread is now being driven by the new variant of the virus, which we first learned about earlier this week. Our advisory group on New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats – NERVTAG – has spent the last few days analysing the new variant. There is no evidence the variant causes more severe illness or higher mortality, but it does appear to be passed on significantly more easily. NERVTAG’s early analysis suggests the new variant could increase R by 0.4 or greater. Although there is considerable uncertainty, it may be up to 70% more transmissible than the old variant. This is early data. It is subject to review. It is the best we have at the moment, and we have to act on information as we have it because this is now spreading very fast. The U.K. has by far the best genomic sequencing ability in the world, which means we are better able to identify new strains like this than any other country. The Chief Medical Officer last night submitted our findings so far to the World Health Organisation and we will continue to be totally transparent with our global partners. There is still much we don’t know. While we are fairly certain the variant is transmitted more quickly, there is no evidence to suggest that it is more lethal or causes more severe illness. Equally there is no evidence to suggest the vaccine will be any less effective against the new variant. Our experts will continue their work to improve our understanding of the variant. So we are learning more about this variant as we go. But we know enough already to be sure that we must act now. I met ministers on the Covid Operations Committee last night and again first thing this morning, and Cabinet met at lunchtime to agree the following actions. First, we will introduce new restrictions in the most affected areas – specifically those parts of London, the South East and the East of England which are currently in tier 3. These areas will enter a new tier 4, which will be broadly equivalent to the national restrictions which were in place in England in November. That means: Residents in those areas must stay at home, apart from limited exemptions set out in law. Non-essential retail, indoor gyms and leisure facilities, and personal care services must close. People must work from home if they can, but may travel to work if this is not possible, for example in the construction and manufacturing sectors. People should not enter or leave tier 4 areas, and tier 4 residents must not stay overnight away from home. Individuals can only meet one person from another household in an outdoor public space. Unlike the November national restrictions, communal worship can continue to take place in tier 4 areas. These measures will take effect from tomorrow morning. All tiers will continue to be regularly reviewed in line with the approach previously set out, with the next formal review point taking place on 30 December. Second, we are issuing new advice on travel. Although the new variant is concentrated in tier 4 areas, it is nonetheless present at lower levels around the country. We are asking everyone, in all tiers, to stay local. People should carefully consider whether they need to travel abroad and follow the rules in their tier. Those in tier 4 areas will not be permitted to travel abroad apart from limited exceptions, such as for work purposes. Third, we must, I am afraid, look again at Christmas. As Prime Minister, it is my duty to take the difficult decisions, to do what is right to protect the people of this country. Given the early evidence we have on this new variant of the virus, and the potential risk it poses, it is with a heavy heart that I must tell you we cannot continue with Christmas as planned. In England, those living in tier 4 areas should not mix with anyone outside their own household at Christmas, though support bubbles will remain in place for those at particular risk of loneliness or isolation. Across the rest of the country, the Christmas rules allowing up to three households to meet will now be limited to Christmas Day only, rather than the five days as previously set out. As before, there will be no relaxation on 31 December, so people must not break the rules at New Year. I know how much emotion people invest in this time of year, and how important it is for grandparents to see their grandchildren, and for families to be together. So I know how disappointing this will be, but we have said throughout this pandemic that we must and we will be guided by the science. When the science changes, we must change our response. When the virus changes its method of attack, we must change our method of defence. As your Prime Minister, I sincerely believe there is no alternative open to me. Without action, the evidence suggests infections would soar, hospitals would become overwhelmed and many thousands more would lose their lives. I want to stress we are not alone in this fight – many of our European friends and neighbours are being forced to take similar action. We are working closely with the devolved administrations to protect people in every part of the UK. Of course there is now hope – real hope – that we will soon be rid of this virus. That prospect is growing with every day that passes and every vaccine dose administered. The UK was the first country in the western world to start using a clinically approve vaccine. So please, if the NHS contacts you then get your vaccine – and join the 350,000 people across the UK who have already had their first dose. Yes, Christmas this year will be very different, but we must be realistic. We are sacrificing our chance to see loved ones this Christmas, so we have a better chance of protecting their lives so we can see them at future Christmases. As sure as night follows day, we will beat back this virus. We will defeat it. And we will reclaim our lives."
"Boris Johnson","Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 21 December 2020","21 December 2020","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-21-december-2020","Prime Minister’s statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 21 December 2020 Good afternoon, I want to update everyone on one thing and that’s what’s happening at our borders and especially at Dover. Last night at 11pm the French Government imposed restrictions on UK freight crossing to France when accompanied by a driver. And so today I chaired a meeting of the Government’s emergency, COBR committee in order to co-ordinate a UK-wide response. And it is vital first to stress that these delays – which are only occurring at Dover – only affect human-handled freight, and that is only 20 per cent of the total arriving from or departing to the European continent, which means the vast majority of food, medicines and other supplies are coming and going as normal. You may also be aware – in fact I’d be amazed if you weren’t – that the government has been preparing for a long time for this exactly kind of event. So working with the Kent Resilience Forum, Kent County Council and Highways England, we’ve activated our long-prepared plans, with the result that we have already been able to reduce the number of lorries waiting on the M20 from 500 to 170. The site at Manston Airfield is ready to cope with any overflow. And, of course, we are working with our friends across the Channel to unblock the flow of trade as fast as possible. The Government at all levels is communicating with our friends in Paris I have just spoken to President Macron - we had a very good call - we both understand each other’s positions and want to resolve these problems as fast as possible. I know that Grant is also speaking to his counterpart and we are working to a solution, as I say, as fast as we can to allow freight traffic to resume between the UK and France, and ensure that lorries can travel in both directions in a Covid-secure way. I want to stress that we in the UK fully understand the anxieties of our friends about Covid, their anxieties about the new variant, but it is also true that we believe the risks of transmission by a solitary driver sitting alone in the cab are really very low. And so we hope to make progress as fast as we possibly can. I want to repeat that these delays only apply to a very small percentage of food entering the UK, and as British supermarkets have said, their supply chains are strong and robust, so everyone can continue to shop normally. And to our international friends and partners I want to say very frankly: We understand your concerns, And I hope that everybody can see that as soon as we were briefed as a government of the fast transmissibility of this new strain at about 3.15pm on Friday afternoon, We lodged all the necessary information with the World Health Organisation And we took prompt and decisive action the very next day to curb the spread of the variant within the UK. And we want to work with our colleagues, with our friends around the world, as we have from the beginning to develop new treatments and new vaccines. And today I can announce that half a million people in the UK have now received their first dose. As we’ve seen throughout this pandemic, this virus alas can move all too swiftly from one nation to another, But it is steadily being defeated by an international response An international response that is bringing the hope of vaccines to the entire world, And in that the UK will continue to play our full part. I’ll now handover to our Secretary of State, Grant."
"Boris Johnson","Prime Minister's statement on EU negotiations: 24 December 2020","24 December 2020","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-statement-on-eu-negotiations-24-december-2020","Prime Minister’s statement on EU negotiations: 24 December 2020 It is four and a half years since the British people voted to take back control of their money, their borders, their laws, and their waters and to leave the European Union. And earlier this year we fulfilled that promise and we left on Jan 31 with that oven-ready deal. Since that time we have been getting on with our agenda. Enacting the points based immigration system that you voted for and that will come into force on Jan 1. And doing free trade deals with 58 countries around the world. And preparing the new relationship with the EU. And there have been plenty of people who have told us that the challenges of the Covid pandemic have made this work impossible. And that we should extend the transition period. And incur yet more delay. And I rejected that approach precisely because beating Covid is our number one national priority and I wanted to end any extra uncertainty and to give this country the best possible chance of bouncing back strongly next year. And so I am very pleased that this afternoon that we have completed the biggest trade deal yet, worth £660 billion. A comprehensive Canada style free trade deal between the UK and the EU, a deal that will protect jobs across this country. A deal that will allow UK goods and components to be sold without tariffs and without quotas in the EU market. A deal which will if anything should allow our companies and our exporters to do even more business with our European friends. And yet which achieves something that the people of this country instinctively knew was doable. But which they were told was impossible. We have taken back control of laws and our destiny. We have taken back control of every jot and tittle of our regulation. In a way that is complete and unfettered. From Jan 1 we are outside the customs union, and outside the single market. British laws will be made solely by the British Parliament. Interpreted by UK judges sitting in UK courts. And the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice will come to an end. We will be able to set our own standards, to innovate in the way that we want, to originate new frameworks for the sectors in which this country leads the world, from biosciences to financial services, artificial intelligence and beyond. We will be able to decide how and where we are going to stimulate new jobs and new hope. With freeports and new green industrial zones. We will be able to cherish our landscape and our environment in the way we choose. Backing our farmers and backing British food and agricultural production. And for the first time since 1973 we will be an independent coastal state with full control of our waters with the UK’s share of fish in our waters rising substantially from roughly half today to closer to 2/3 in five and a half years’ time after which there is no theoretical limit beyond those placed by science or conservation on the quantity of our own fish that we can fish in our waters. And to get ready for that moment those fishing communities we will be helped with a big £100m programme to modernise their fleets and the fish processing industry. And I want to stress that although of course the arguments with our European friends and partners were sometimes fierce this is, I believe a good deal for the whole of Europe and for our friends and partners as well. Because it will not be a bad thing for the EU to have a prosperous and dynamic and contented UK on your doorstep. And it will be a good thing – it will drive jobs and prosperity across the whole continent. And I don’t think it will be a bad thing if we in the UK do things differently, or a take a different approach to legislation. Because in so many ways our basic goals are the same. And in the context of this giant free trade zone that we’re jointly creating the stimulus of regulatory competition will I think benefit us both. And if one side believes it is somehow being unfairly undercut by the other, then subject to independent third party arbitration and provided the measures are proportionate, we can either of us decide – as sovereign equals - to protect our consumers. But this treaty explicitly envisages that such action should only happen infrequently and the concepts of uniformity and harmonisation are banished in favour of mutual respect and mutual recognition and free trade. And for squaring that circle, for finding the philosopher’s stone that’s enabled us to do this I want to thank President von der Leyen of the European Commission and our brilliant negotiators led by Lord Frost and Michel Barnier, on the EU side Stephanie Rousseau as well as Oliver Lewis, Tim Barrow, Lindsay Appleby and many others. Their work will be available for scrutiny, followed by a parliamentary vote I hope on Dec 30. This agreement, this deal above all means certainty. It means certainty for the aviation industry and the hauliers who have suffered so much in the Covid pandemic. It means certainty for the police and the border forces and the security services and all those that we rely on across Europe to keep us safe. It means certainty for our scientists who will be able to continue to work together on great collective projects. Because although we want the UK to be a science superpower, we also want to be a collaborative science superpower. And above all it means certainty for business from financial services to our world-leading manufacturers – our car industry – certainty for those working in high skilled jobs in firms and factories across the whole country. Because there will be no palisade of tariffs on Jan 1. And there will be no non-tariff barriers to trade. And instead there will be a giant free trade zone of which we will at once be a member. And at the same time be able to do our own free trade deals as one UK, whole and entire, England, NI, Scotland and Wales together. And I should stress this deal was done by a huge negotiating team from every part of the UK, and it will benefit every part of our United Kingdom, helping to unite and level up across the country. And so I say again directly to our EU friends and partners, I think this deal means a new stability and a new certainty in what has sometimes been a fractious and difficult relationship. We will be your friend, your ally, your supporter and indeed – never let it be forgotten – your number one market. Because although we have left the EU this country will remain culturally, emotionally, historically, strategically and geologically attached to Europe, not least through the four million EU nationals who have requested to settle in the UK over the last four years and who make an enormous contribution to our country and to our lives. And I say to all of you at home. At the end of this toughest of years. That our focus in the weeks ahead is of course on defeating the pandemic. And on beating coronavirus and rebuilding our economy. And delivering jobs across the country. And I am utterly confident that we can and will do it. By today we have vaccinated almost 800,000 people and we have also today resolved a question that has bedevilled our politics for decades. And it is up to us all together. As a newly and truly independent nation. To realise the immensity of this moment and to make the most of it. Happy Christmas to you all. That’s the good news from Brussels – now for the sprouts."
"Boris Johnson","Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 30 December 2020","30 December 2020","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-30-december-2020","Prime Minister’s statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 30 December 2020 Today I want to begin with the good news: the approval of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine which is a fantastic achievement for British science And which will allow us to vaccinate more people, and also vaccinate them more quickly. And there is one important development that’s helping us to accelerate our vaccination programme across the whole of the UK: We’ve had new advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation that the first dose can protect people against the worst effects of this virus because the benefits kick in after two or three weeks. And so from now on we will give a first dose to as many vulnerable people as possible, with the second dose to follow twelve weeks later. And what that means is we can vaccinate and protect many more people in the coming weeks. I know everyone watching this will want to know when you can get your vaccine and all I want to say is we are working as hard and as fast as we can to get the supplies to you, and as soon as we have the supplies we will be getting them into people’s arms To summarise where we are We have to face the fact we’ve got two big things happening at once in our fight against Covid - One is working for us; and one working against us. On the plus side we have two valid vaccines and we are racing, as I say, to get them out. On the downside, there is a new strain of the virus which is spreading much faster and surging across the country. And we have seen a 40 per cent increase in cases in England in the last week alone, almost 15 per cent more patients in hospital – more than at the peak of the first wave. And yesterday sadly we recorded almost a thousand deaths across the UK, for the first time since April. So at this critical moment with the prospect of freedom within reach We’ve got to redouble our efforts to contain the virus. That’s why the Health Secretary has announced that more areas of England will be moving into Tier 4 from tomorrow And as I say again, no-one regrets these measures more bitterly than I do. But we must take firm action now and that’s why we have to think very hard about schools. Because today of course it remains the case that keeping children in education is a national priority it remains the case that schools are safe. But we must face the reality that the sheer pace of the spread of this new variant requires us now to take even tougher action in some areas and that does affect schools Let me set out for you what this means. In most of England, primary schools will still reassemble next week, as planned for the new term. But, in the areas we have just published today on gov.uk, I am afraid the start of the new term will be delayed until at least January 18, when the latest data on those infection rates will be reviewed. That is because the rate of transmission in these areas is so high, and there’s just such pressure on the local NHS, that extra action is required to control the spread of the virus. The children of key workers, or those who are considered to be vulnerable, will still go back to primary schools from next week – wherever they live in England. They are not affected by today’s announcement. In secondary schools, all vulnerable children and the children of critical workers will go back next week across England, as originally planned. But we will ask exam year pupils in secondary schools to learn remotely during the first week of term and return to the classroom from 11 January. The remaining secondary school pupils, i.e. non exam groups will go back a week later, that is from 18 January – but I want to stress that depending on the spread of the disease it may be necessary to take further action in their cases as well, in as I say the worst affected areas. To minimise disruption in schools and to fight the disease we are massively expanding our testing operation ensuring that every secondary school pupil is tested as they return, and regularly thereafter. Again I want to thank the teachers, pupils and parents who have worked so hard to keep schools safe and keep them open. We are also asking universities to reduce the number of students who return to campus in January, prioritising medical courses and others requiring face to face teaching. And in all cases, students should be offered two rapid tests when they return. All of these measures are in the end designed to save lives and to protect the NHS. And for that very reason, I must ask you to follow the rules where you live tomorrow night and see in the New Year safely at home. That means not meeting up with friends or family indoors, unless they are in the same household or support bubble, and avoiding large gatherings of any kind. We are still in the tunnel of this pandemic the light however is not merely visible: thanks to an extraordinary feat of British engineering if you like the tunnel has been shortened and we are moving faster through it, and that gives me great confidence about the future in the Spring So for now let’s double our efforts, let’s follow the rules, protect our NHS and together make 2021 the year we leave this tunnel behind us."
"Boris Johnson","Prime Minister's opening statement to the House of Commons on the UK-EU deal: 30 December 2020","30 December 2020","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-opening-statement-to-the-house-of-commons-on-the-uk-eu-deal-30-december-2020","Thank you Mr Speaker, can I begin by thanking you and the House authorities and all your staff and their hard work in allowing us to meet today, and can I also welcome the outstanding news that AstraZeneca is now rolling out a new UK made vaccine approved by the MHRA that offers the hope to millions in this country and around the world, Mr Speaker I beg to move that the Bill be now read a second time, and having taken back control of our money, our borders, our laws and our waters by leaving the European Union on Jan 31st, we now seize the moment to forge a fantastic new relationship with our European neighbours, based on free trade and friendly co-operation. And at the heart of this Bill is one of the biggest free trade agreements in the world, a comprehensive Canada-style deal, worth over £660 billion, which, if anything, should allow our companies to do even more business with our European friends, safeguarding millions of jobs and livelihoods in our UK and across the continent. In less than 48 hours, we will leave the EU single market and the customs union, as we promised and yet British exporters will not face a sudden thicket of trade barriers, but rather, for the first time in the history of EU agreements, zero tariffs and zero quotas. And just as we have avoided trade barriers, so we have also ensured the UK’s full control of our laws and our regulations and there is a vital symmetry between those two achievements, because the central purpose of this Bill is to accomplish something that the British people always knew in their hearts could be done, but which we were continually told was impossible, we were told we could not have our cake and eat it, do you remember how often we were told that Mr Speaker, namely that we could trade and cooperate with our European neighbours on the closest terms of friendship and goodwill, whilst retaining sovereign control of our laws and our national destiny. And that unifying thread runs through every clause of this Bill, it embodies our vision – shared with our European neighbours – of a new relationship between Britain and the EU as sovereign equals, joined by friendship, commerce, history, interests and values, while respecting one another’s freedom of action and recognising that we have nothing to fear if we sometimes choose to do things differently and we have much to gain from the healthy stimulus of competition. And this Bill demonstrates therefore how Britain can be at once European and sovereign. And I think you’ll agree Mr Speaker our negotiators accomplished their feat with astonishing speed. It took nearly 8 years for the Uruguay Round of world trade talks to produce a deal, and five years for the EU to reach a trade agreement with Canada, six for Japan. We have done this in less than a year, in the teeth of a pandemic, and we have pressed ahead with this task, resisting all the calls for delay, Mr Speaker precisely because creating certainty about our future provides the best chance of beating Covid and bouncing back even more strongly next year. And that was our objective. So I hope the House will join me in commending my Noble Friend Lord Frost and every member of his team for their skill, their mastery and their perseverance in translating our vision into a practical agreement. And let me also pay tribute to President Ursula von der Leyen, Michel Barnier and all our European friends for their pragmatism and foresight and for their understanding that it is profoundly in the interests of the EU to live alongside a prosperous, contented and sovereign United Kingdom. The House understands the significance of the fact that the basis of this agreement is not EU law but international law, so there is no direct effect, the EU law will no longer have any special status in the UK and there is no jurisdiction for the European Court of Justice. We will be able to design our own standards and regulations, And Mr Speaker the laws that this House of Commons passes will be interpreted – and I know this is of keen interest to honourable and right honourable members - solely by British judges sitting in British courts. We will have opportunity to devise new ways to spur and encourage the flourishing sectors in which this country leads the world, from green energy and life sciences to synthetic biology. We will be free Mr Speaker of EU state aid rules, We’ll be able to decide where and how we level up across our country with new jobs and new hope, including with freeports and new green industrial zones of a kind I’m sure he’d approve of. And if, in using our new freedoms, either Britain or the EU believes it is somehow being unfairly undercut, then subject to independent third party arbitration - and provided the measures are proportionate - either of us can decide, as sovereign equals, to protect our consumers. But this treaty explicitly envisages that any such action should be infrequent and it banishes the old concepts of uniformity and harmonisation in favour of the right to make our own regulatory choices and deal with the consequences. And Mr Speaker, every modern free trade agreement includes reciprocal commitments designed to prevent distortions of trade and the true significance of the agreement embodied in this Bill is that there is no role for the European Court of Justice, no ratchet clause on labour or environmental standards and no dynamic alignment with the EU State Aid regime - or indeed any other aspect of EU law. In every respect, we have recovered our freedom of action. We will be free of the strictures of the Common Agricultural Policy, We’ll be able to conserve our landscapes and support our farmers exactly as we choose. And on Friday – for the first time 50 years – on Friday the UK will once again be recognised as an independent coastal state, regaining control of our waters, righting the wrong that was done by the Common Fisheries Policy throughout our EU Membership. And of course, I’ve always recognised Mr Speaker that this was going to be a difficult period for our European friends and partners, because they’ve been fishing in these waters for decades if not centuries and at first - as the House will know - they sought an adjustment period of 14 years, but our negotiators whittled that down to five and a half years, during which the UK’s share - in that five and a half years – the UK’s share of our fish in our waters will rise from over half today to around two thirds. And of course we would like to have done this more quickly, but it’s also true that once the adjustment period comes to an end, there will be no limit Mr speaker – other than the limits placed by the needs of science and conservation – on our ability to make use of our marine wealth, and 15 per cent of the EU’s historic catch from our waters will be returned to this country next year alone. And as I say to prepare our fishing communities for that moment, we will invest £100 million in a programme to modernise their fleets and the fish processing industry, Restoring Mr Speaker a great British industry to the eminence that it deserves, levelling up communities across the UK – particularly and including in Scotland Where their interests in my view have been neglected for too long. So I do find it extraordinary that on the eve of this great opportunity the declared position of the Scottish National nationalist Party is to hand control – with a small n – is to hand control of the very waters we have just reclaimed straight back to the EU. That is their policy Mr Speaker. And they plan to ensnare Scotland’s fishing fleet in the dragnets of the Common Fisheries Policy all over again. And, in the meantime, Mr Speaker – guess what they are going to do today - they are going to vote today for a “No Deal Brexit”, proving once and for all, that the interests of Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland are best served by a One Nation party serving One United Kingdom. Mr Speaker, this deal was negotiated by a big team, and he should know this, from every part of our United Kingdom, and it serves the whole of the UK, not least by protecting the integrity of the United Kingdom single internal market and Northern Ireland’s place within it. Our points-based immigration system will end free movement and give us full control over who enters our country and by the way on that point I want to thank very much my right honourable friend the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster for all he did to protect the interest of Northern Ireland. And at the same time the deal provides certainty for airlines and hauliers – who have suffered grievously during this pandemic – It guarantees the freedom of British citizens to travel to and from the EU, and retain access to healthcare. It provides certainty for our police, for our border forces, for our security agencies, who work alongside our European friends to keep our people safe. They are going to vote against this Mr Speaker. It provides certainty for our partnerships on scientific research, because we want our country to be a science superpower, but also a collaborative science superpower. And it provides certainty for business Mr Speaker. from financial services to our world leading manufactures, including our car industry, safeguarding highly skilled jobs and investment across our country. As for the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Speaker, I am delighted that he has found yet another position on Brexit, and having plunged down every blind alley and exhausted every possible alternative, he has come to the right conclusion, namely to vote for this agreement which this Government has secured. But alas the good news about the Labour party stops there Because I’m told the Right Honourable Gentleman intends to ask the British people for a mandate to rewrite the deal in 2024. That’s what he wants to do. I think frankly Mr Speaker we got Brexit done, let’s keep Brexit done, and let’s keep Brexit done, and let’s press ahead with this Government’s mission to unite and level up across our whole country and grasp the opportunities before us. Because I have always said that Brexit is not an end but a beginning, and the responsibility now rests with all of us to make the best use of the powers that we have regained, and the tools that we have taken back into our hands. And we’re going to begin by fulfilling our manifesto promise to maintain the highest standards of labour and environmental regulation, because no caricature could be more inaccurate than the idea of some bargain basement, Dickensian Britain, as if enlightened EU regulation has in the past been our only salvation from Dickensian squalor. Our national standards have always been among the very best in the world and this House can be trusted to use its new freedom to keep them that way, without any outside invigilation. We are going to open Mr Speaker a new chapter in our national story, striking free trade deals around the world, adding to the agreements with 63 countries we have already achieved, and reasserting Global Britain as a liberal, outward-looking force for good. Detaching ourselves from the EU is only a prelude to the greater task of establishing our new role, and this country is contributing more than any other to vaccinate people across the world against Covid and leading the way in preventing future pandemics and we will continue to campaign for 12 years of quality education for every girl in the world and I thank my right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary for what he’s doing on that, and we will continue to lead the drive towards global net zero, as we host COP26 in Glasgow next year. And I hope and believe – and I think actually the tone this morning has given me encouragement in this belief Mr Speaker – the mood in the House this morning which seems to me on the whole to be positive. I hope in spite of the as usual, thin, synthetic, confected indignation that we hear from some of the benches opposite – I hope and believe that this agreement will also serve to end some of the rancour and recrimination that we’ve had in recent years, allow us to come to together as a country, to leave old arguments, old desiccated super masticated arguments behind, move on and build a new and great future for our country. Because those of us who campaigned for Britain to leave the EU never sought a rupture with our closest neighbours. We never wanted to sever ourselves from fellow democracies beneath whose soil lie British war graves in tranquil cemeteries, often tended by local schoolchildren, testament to our shared struggle for freedom and everything we cherish in common. What we wanted was not a rupture but a resolution, a resolution of the old, tired, vexed question of Britain’s political relations with Europe, which has bedevilled our post-War history. First, we stood aloof, then we became a half-hearted, sometimes obstructive member of the EU. Now, with this Bill, we are going to become a friendly neighbour – the best friend and ally the EU could have – working hand-in-glove whenever our values and interests coincide while fulfilling the sovereign wish of the British people to live under their own laws, made by their own elected Parliament. That is the historic resolution delivered by this Bill and Mr Speaker I commend it to the House."
"Boris Johnson","Prime Minister's address to the nation: 4 January 2021","4 January 2021","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-address-to-the-nation-4-january-2021","Prime Minister’s address to the nation: 4 January 2021 Since the pandemic began last year, the whole United Kingdom has been engaged in a great national effort to fight Covid. And there is no doubt that in fighting the old variant of the virus, our collective efforts were working and would have continued to work. But we now have a new variant of the virus. It has been both frustrating and alarming to see the speed with which the new variant is spreading. Our scientists have confirmed this new variant is between 50 and 70 per cent more transmissible – that means you are much, much more likely to catch the virus and to pass it on. As I speak to you tonight, our hospitals are under more pressure from Covid than at any time since the start of the pandemic. In England alone, the number of Covid patients in hospitals has increased by nearly a third in the last week, to almost 27,000. That number is 40 per cent higher than the first peak in April. On 29 December, more than 80,000 people tested positive for Covid across the UK – a new record. The number of deaths is up by 20 per cent over the last week and will sadly rise further. My thoughts are with all those who have lost loved ones. With most of the country already under extreme measures, it is clear that we need to do more, together, to bring this new variant under control while our vaccines are rolled out. In England, we must therefore go into a national lockdown which is tough enough to contain this variant. That means the Government is once again instructing you to stay at home. You may only leave home for limited reasons permitted in law, such as to shop for essentials, to work if you absolutely cannot work from home, to exercise, to seek medical assistance such as getting a Covid test, or to escape domestic abuse. The full details on what you can and can’t do will be available at gov.uk/coronavirus. If you are clinically extremely vulnerable, we are advising you to begin shielding again and you will shortly receive a letter about what this means for you. And because we now have to do everything we possibly can to stop the spread of the disease, primary schools, secondary schools and colleges across England must move to remote provision from tomorrow, except for vulnerable children and the children of key workers. Everyone will still be able to access early years settings such as nurseries. We recognise that this will mean it is not possible or fair for all exams to go ahead this summer as normal. The Education Secretary will work with Ofqual to put in place alternative arrangements. We will provide extra support to ensure that pupils entitled to free school meals will continue to receive them while schools are closed, and we’ll distribute more devices to support remote education. I completely understand the inconvenience and distress this late change will cause millions of parents and pupils up and down the country. Parents whose children were in school today may reasonably ask why we did not take this decision sooner. The answer is simply that we have been doing everything in our power to keep schools open, because we know how important each day in education is to children’s life chances. And I want to stress that the problem is not that schools are unsafe for children – children are still very unlikely to be severely affected by even the new variant of Covid. The problem is that schools may nonetheless act as vectors for transmission, causing the virus to spread between households. Today the United Kingdom’s Chief Medical Officers have advised that the country should move to alert level 5, meaning that if action is not taken NHS capacity may be overwhelmed within 21 days. Of course, there is one huge difference compared to last year. We are now rolling out the biggest vaccination programme in our history. So far, we in the UK have vaccinated more people than the rest of Europe combined. With the arrival today of the UK’s own Oxford Astra Zeneca vaccine, the pace of vaccination is accelerating. I can share with you tonight the NHS’s realistic expectations for the vaccination programme in the coming weeks. By the middle of February, if things go well and with a fair wind in our sails, we expect to have offered the first vaccine dose to everyone in the four top priority groups identified by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation. That means vaccinating all residents in a care home for older adults and their carers, everyone over the age of 70, all frontline health and social care workers, and everyone who is clinically extremely vulnerable. If we succeed in vaccinating all those groups, we will have removed huge numbers of people from the path of the virus. And of course, that will eventually enable us to lift many of the restrictions we have endured for so long. I must stress that even if we achieve this goal, there remains a time lag of two to three weeks from getting a jab to receiving immunity. And there will be a further time lag before the pressure on the NHS is lifted. So we should remain cautious about the timetable ahead. But if our understanding of the virus doesn’t change dramatically once again… If the rollout of the vaccine programme continues to be successful… If deaths start to fall as the vaccine takes effect… And, critically, if everyone plays their part by following the rules… Then I hope we can steadily move out of lockdown, reopening schools after the February half term and starting, cautiously, to move regions down the tiers. I want to say to everyone right across the United Kingdom that I know how tough this is, I know how frustrated you are, I know that you have had more than enough of government guidance about defeating this virus. But now more than ever, we must pull together. You should follow the new rules from now, and they will become law in the early hours of Wednesday morning. Parliament will meet – largely remotely – later that day. I know that the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland share my conviction this is a pivotal moment and they’re taking similar steps. The weeks ahead will be the hardest yet but I really do believe that we are entering the last phase of the struggle. Because with every jab that goes into our arms, we are tilting the odds against Covid and in favour of the British people. And, thanks to the miracle of science, not only is the end in sight and we know exactly how we will get there. But for now, I am afraid, you must once again stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives. Thank you all very much."
"Boris Johnson","Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 5 January 2021","5 January 2021","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-5-january-2021","Prime Minister’s statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 5 January 2021 Good afternoon, I want to update everybody about vaccines because across this entire country today there are people – everybody - making another huge sacrifice. Teachers and pupils coping with online learning Businesses who have borne the brunt of successive lockdowns and, of course, the amazing staff of our NHS and our care workers who are grappling with a new variant - this new variant - of coronavirus. And I believe that when everybody looks at the position people understand overwhelmingly that we have no choice when the Office of National Statistics is telling us that more than 2 per cent of the population is now infected that’s over 1 million people in England – and when today we have reported another 60,000 new cases and when the number of patients in hospitals in England is now 40 per cent higher than at the first peak in April. I think obviously – everybody, you all - want to be sure that we in government are now using every second of this lockdown to put that invisible shield around the elderly and the vulnerable in the form of vaccination and so to begin to bring this crisis to an end. And I can tell you that this afternoon with Pfizer and Oxford/AstraZeneca combined – as of this afternoon we have now vaccinated over 1.1 million people in England and over 1.3 million across the UK. And that includes more than 650,000 people over 80 which is 23 per cent of all the over 80s in England - And that means that nearly 1 in 4 of one of the most vulnerable groups will have in 2 to 3 weeks – all of them - a significant degree of immunity. And when you consider that the average age of Covid fatalities is in the 80s You can see the importance of what we have already achieved. And that is why I believe that the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation was right to draw up a programme aimed at saving the most lives the fastest. So by February 15th, as I said last night, the NHS is committed to offering a vaccination to everyone in the top four priority groups including older care home residents and staff, everyone over 70, all frontline NHS and care staff and all those who are clinically extremely vulnerable. And to help us with meeting this target we already have 595 GP-led sites providing vaccines, with a further 180 coming on stream later this week. We have 107 hospital sites – with a further 100 later this week So that is almost a thousand sites – vaccination sites - across the country by the end of this week And next week we will also have 7 vaccination centres opening in places such as sports stadia and exhibition centres. We know that there will still be long weeks ahead in which we must persevere with these restrictions but I want to give you – the British people – the maximum possible transparency about this vaccine roll out with more detail on Thursday and daily updates from Monday so that you can see day by day and jab by jab how much progress we are making. Thanks very much I am now going to hand over to Chris to do the slides."
"Boris Johnson","Prime Minister's statement to the House of Commons on COVID-19 regulations: 6 January 2021","6 January 2021","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-statement-to-the-house-of-commons-on-covid-19-regulations-6-january-2021","Thank you very much Mr Speaker and can I share your gratitude to the House of Commons staff for all their efforts, their hard work to allow us to meet today in the way that we are. And before I begin my statement, I know the thoughts of the whole House are with the Hon Member for Cardiff Central who is currently in hospital with Covid, and we wish her a full and speedy recovery. With permission, I shall make a statement about the measures we are taking to defeat this new variant of Covid-19, protecting our NHS whilst it carries out the vaccinations that will finally free us from this wretched virus. And Mr Speaker, there is a fundamental difference between the regulations before the House today, and the position we have faced at any previous stage, because now we have the vaccines that are the means of our escape and we will use every available second of the lockdown to place this invisible shield around the elderly and the vulnerable. Already – with Pfizer and Oxford/AstraZeneca combined – we have immunised over 1.1 million people in England and over 1.3 million in the UK. Our NHS is following the plan drawn up by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation which is aimed at saving the most lives in the fastest possible time. And given that the average age of Covid fatalities is over 80, it is significant that we have already vaccinated more than 650,000 people in this age group, meaning that within 2 to 3 weeks, almost 1 in 4 of one of the most vulnerable groups will all have a significant degree of immunity. By February 15th the NHS is committed to offering a vaccination to everyone in the top four priority groups including older care home residents and staff everyone over 70 all frontline NHS and care staff and all those who are clinically extremely vulnerable. And in working towards that target there are already almost 1,000 vaccination centres across the country including 595 GP-led sites with a further 180 opening later this week and 107 hospital sites – with another 100 later this week Next week we will also have seven vaccination centres opening in places such as sports stadia and exhibition centres. Pharmacies are already working with GPs to deliver the vaccine in many areas of the country and I am grateful to Brigadier Prosser who is leading the efforts of our armed forces in supporting this vaccine rollout. We have already vaccinated more people in this country than in the rest of Europe combined and we will give the House the maximum possible transparency about our acceleration of this effort publishing daily updates online from Monday so that jab by jab Hon Members can scrutinise the progress being made every single day. Yet as we take this giant leap towards finally overcoming this virus and reclaiming our lives, we have to contend with the new variant which is between 50 and 70 per cent more contagious. The old variant, which the House agreed last month, the tiers agreed by this House last month was working with the old variant. But, alas, this mutation spreading with frightening ease and speed in spite of the sterling work of the British public – has led to more cases than we have ever seen before, alas numbers that cannot be explained away by the meteoric rise in testing. When the Office for National Statistics reports that more than 2 per cent of the population is now infected, and when the number of patients in hospitals in England is now 40 per cent higher than the first peak in April, it is inescapable that the facts are changing and we must change our response. And so we now have no choice but to return to a national lockdown in England with similar measures being adopted by the Devolved Administrations – so we can control this new variant until we can take the most likely victims out of its path with vaccines. My Rt Hon Friend the Secretary of State for Health will open the debate on the full regulations shortly, but the key point I am afraid is that we are once again instructing everyone to stay at home, everyone to stay at home leaving only for limited reasons permitted by law, such as to shop for essentials, to work if people absolutely cannot work from home, to exercise, to seek medical assistance such as getting a Covid test, or to escape injury or harm, including domestic abuse. We are advising the clinically extremely vulnerable to begin shielding again. And because we must do everything possible to stop the spread of the disease we have asked schools and colleges to close their doors to all except vulnerable children and those of critical workers. Mr Speaker, I don’t think the House will be in any doubt about our determination, my determination to keep schools open, especially primary schools – open for as long as possible. Because all the evidence shows that school is the best place for our children. And indeed all the evidence shows that schools are safe, and that the risk posed to children by Coronavirus is vanishingly small. For most children the most dangerous part of going to school, even in the midst of this global pandemic, remains I’m afraid crossing the road in order to get there. But the data showed, and our scientific advisers agreed, that our efforts to contain the spread of this new variant would not be sufficient if schools continued to act as a potential vector for spreading the virus between households. Mr Speaker, I know the whole House will join me in paying tribute to all the teachers, all the pupils and parents who are now making the rapid move to remote learning, and we will do everything possible to support that process, building on the 560,000 laptops and tablets provided last year with over 50,000 delivered to schools on Monday and more than 100,000 being delivered in total during the first week of term. We have partnered with some of the UK’s leading mobile operators to provide free mobile data to disadvantaged families to support access to education resources. And I am very grateful to EE, Three, Tesco Mobile, Smarty, Sky Mobile, Virgin Mobile and Vodafone for supporting this offer. Oak National Academy will continue to provide video lessons and it’s very good news that the BBC is launching the biggest education programme in its history, with both primary and secondary school programmes across its platforms. We recognise it will not be possible or fair for all exams to go ahead this Summer as normal. And the Education Secretary will be making a statement shortly. Mr Speaker, I know many people will ask whether the decision on schools could have been reached sooner, and the answer is that we have been doing everything in our power to keep them open because children’s education is too vital, and their futures too precious, to be disrupted until every other avenue, every other option had been closed off and every other course of action had been taken. That is why schools were the very last thing to close, as I have long promised they would be. And when we begin to move out of lockdown I promise they will be the very first things to reopen. That moment may come after the February half-term, although we should remain extremely cautious about the timetable ahead. And as was the case last spring, our emergence from the lockdown cocoon will be not a big bang but a gradual unwrapping. That is why the legislation this House will vote on later today runs until 31 March. Not because we expect the full national lockdown to continue until then, but to allow a steady, controlled and evidence-led move down through the tiers on a regional basis carefully brick-by-brick as it were breaking free of our confinement but without risking the hard-won gains that protections have given us. The restrictions will be kept under continuous review, with a statutory requirement to review every two weeks and a legal obligation to remove them if they are no longer deemed necessary to limit the transmission of the virus. And for as long as restrictions are in place we will continue to support everyone affected by them from the continued provision of free school meals to the £4.6 billion of additional assistance for our retail, hospitality and leisure sectors announced by my Rt Hon Friend the Chancellor yesterday. Mr Speaker, we are in a tough final stretch made only tougher by the new variant – but this country will come together and the miracle of scientific endeavour, much of it right here in the UK, has given us not only the sight of the finish line but a clear route to get there. After the marathon of last year we are indeed now in a sprint, a race to vaccinate the vulnerable faster than the virus can reach them. Every needle in every arm makes a difference, As I say we are already vaccinating faster than any comparable country and that rate I hope will only increase. But if we’re going to win this race for our population we have to give our army of vaccinators the biggest head start we possibly can. And that is why to do that we must once again stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives. And I commend this statement to the House."
"Boris Johnson","Inclusion, partnership and an international approach to fragility and security","6 January 2021","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/inclusion-partnership-and-an-international-approach-to-fragility-and-security","Mr President, thank you for convening this timely debate. My thanks also to Secretary-General Guterres, Mr Faki and Mrs Johnson Sirleaf for clearly outlining the challenge. We see, all too often, the devastating impact of conflict on a country and its neighbours. As the war in Syria rages on, over 9 million of its people cannot afford basic food supplies. More than 6 million – including 2½ million children - are refugees far from home. On either side of the border, COVID-19 has only made their situation more precarious. This fragility is a key challenge to the peace and security we all desire. By 2030, 80% of the world’s extreme poor will live in fragile states and regions. While our attention is still on the health impact of COVID-19, we know its social and economic effects will magnify that trend. We also know that sustainable development and economic growth are just not possible without peace. Mr President, I want to highlight three key elements to maintain international peace and security: inclusion, partnership and an integrated approach to fragility and security. To my first point: peace processes are often the domain of a small number of well-connected men. But we know that peace will not last, if half the population aren’t represented at the negotiating table. Women and community leaders must have a seat from the start. Their meaningful participation can prevent conflict, support conflict resolution and maintain peace. We need to protect and clear the path for women who speak up for their rights, their communities and their futures. The UK has supported the International Civil Society Action Network to develop the Protection Framework for women peacebuilders. As the Council’s penholder on the Women, Peace and Security agenda, we urge all member states to commit to its recommendations. To my second point, the UN and African Union are stronger together as partners for peacebuilding. The collaboration that delivered the Central African Republic peace agreement, and AU mediation in Sudan are just two examples of how our partnership promotes peace. I commend the progress made by the African Union on Silencing the Guns, bolstering the African Peace and Security Architecture, the Panel of the Wise and FemWise. Through the UN, the UK is helping train African peacekeepers, and we recently deployed 300 military personnel to MINUSMA. I also welcome the recent extraordinary meeting of IGAD heads of state to discuss regional security concerns. However, resolution will come not only with discussion, but with difficult choices and action. Thirdly, I want to state the importance of an integrated approach to prevent conflict. The recent Twin Resolutions on Sustaining Peace show the international community’s determination to address the causes before the guns start firing. We have mechanisms to help us, like the African Union’s Continental Early Warning System, which the UK supports. Effective interventions need to span humanitarian, development and peacebuilding operations. The UK worked with the OECD to develop the Recommendation on the Humanitarian-Development-Peace nexus, which will guide future interventions. It is also important that the UN and International Financial Institutions continue developing their working partnership. We welcome the cooperation between the UN, World Bank, EU and Government of Burkina Faso that helped unlock $700 million of World Bank funding. To sum up, the challenges to maintaining peace continue to grow and the costs of excluding women and failing to think holistically become ever more apparent. But there is light. The UN has taken positive steps in its ability to maintain peace in fragile settings, including the Secretary-General’s reform agenda. The UN’s capacity to prevent and respond to conflict has been bolstered through the Peacebuilding Fund, the Multi-year Appeal and the Peace and Development Advisors. The Peacebuilding Commission is now a critical forum for international cooperation on fragile states and regions. Crucially, we better understand the importance of inclusive peace-making and peacebuilding. We know we are more effective when we work with regional partners on complex challenges. And we know the value of tackling the drivers of conflict before a shot is fired. In an evolving world, as we continue to adapt, our partnerships are our strength, inclusion is our security, and the prize is peace."
"Boris Johnson","Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 7 January 2021","7 January 2021","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-7-january-2021","Prime Minister’s statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 7 January 2021 Good afternoon, today I’m joined by Sir Simon Stevens, Chief Executive of NHS England and Brigadier Phil Prosser, who is Commander of Military Support to the Vaccine Delivery Programme across our United Kingdom. Because I know there is now one question at the very top of your minds and that is how fast and how effectively we can get these millions of new vaccines into the arms of the most vulnerable and those who need them most. And you want to know that we in government, the NHS, the Armed Forces, local and regional government, government at every level are truly throwing everything at it round the clock if necessary. And I believe that with the country once again in lockdown and all the difficulties that means for you, for your family, for students, for education, for your businesses, and of course with the tragic number of deaths that we’re seeing and that we’ve seen today, you have a right to understand exactly how we are cracking this problem and how the national vaccine effort is progressing. And you rightly want to know how we are going to reach the target that I set out earlier this week of offering a slot for vaccination by 15th of February for everyone in those key groups identified by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation That’s over 12 million people in England, and 15 million in the UK including older care home residents and staff everyone 70 or over all frontline NHS and care staff and all those who are clinically extremely vulnerable. And just to remind you of the importance of these groups for fighting the disease they account for 88 per cent of all those who have sadly lost their lives. And so our tactics are first to use the immense natural capacity of the NHS and by the end of next week there will be over 1,000 GP-led sites providing vaccines 223 hospital sites seven giant vaccination centres and a first wave of 200 community pharmacies If all goes well these together should have the capacity to deliver hundreds of thousands of vaccines per day by Jan 15th and it is our plan that everyone should have a vaccination available within a radius of ten miles. And it follows from that that the limits will not be on our distributional power but on the supply of vaccines. And I have no doubt that we have enough supply to vaccinate these four groups by the Feb 15th deadline and we also have the distributional network to do it and to continue an expanding programme down that priority list. Yes, let’s be clear this is a national challenge on a scale like nothing we have seen before and it will require an unprecedented national effort. And, of course there will be difficulties appointments will be changed but as Brigadier Prosser will shortly explain the army is working hand in glove with the NHS and local councils to set up our vaccine network and using battle preparation techniques to help us keep up the pace. We will publish our full vaccine deployment plan on Monday along with daily updates on the progress we are making. We have now vaccinated 1.26 million people in England, 113,000 in Scotland, 49,000 in Wales, and 46,000 in Northern Ireland. So altogether, nearly 1.5 million people across the UK have now received their first dose and within 2-3 weeks all of them will have a very considerable degree of immunity. And it is thanks to the arrival of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine which can be stored at room temperature, that we can accelerate the pace of vaccination in care homes. We are using that vaccine in care homes for the first time today and by the end of the month we hope to have offered every elderly care home resident a vaccine. Our new National Booking Service will also make it easier to book and access appointments So I urge everyone to comes forwards because it’s absolutely vital that we should have confidence in these vaccines. And I want to thank everyone involved in this extraordinary national effort all the GPs, nurses, pharmacists and all the staff behind the scenes our armed forces local councils our scientists who have not only developed the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, the first ever life-saving treatment of Covid in the form of dexamethasone – but I am pleased to tell you today, British scientific research has now contributed to the creation of more new lifesaving treatments that have just passed rigorous clinical trials. In particular, Tocilizumab, sorry I’ll say it again, Tocilizumab and Sarilumab, they’ll shortly be on everybody’s lips which have been found to reduce the risk of death for critically ill patients by almost a quarter and they’ve cut time spent in intensive care by as much as ten days and these lifesaving drugs will be available through the NHS with immediate effect, potentially saving thousands of lives. And finally again I want to thank you – the British public – for coming forward to be vaccinated in the numbers that you have - still greater than all the countries of Europe put together. And yes of course, we are in a race against time but I can assure you we’re doing everything we can to vaccinate as many people as possible across our whole United Kingdom. And in the meantime please stay at home, protect our NHS and save lives. And now I’ll hand over to Sir Simon Stevens"
"Boris Johnson","Prime Minister's address to the One Planet Summit","11 January 2021","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-address-to-the-one-planet-summit","Christine thank you very much, I want to thank you and I want to thank Emmanuel for organising this One Planet Summit, because I think it’s an absolutely crucial subject. After all, we’re making a lot of progress as humanity in finding the technological solutions to tackle climate change and reduce carbon. Clearly there’s a huge amount still to do but we’re starting to see a way forward since the Paris Summit five years ago which was I think a huge success, we can see that humanity can do this. But the problem is that we are destroying species and habitat at an absolutely unconscionable rate. I think we’ve lost about 500 species in the last century, of all the mammals in the world – the biomass of mammals – I think I’m right in saying that 96% of mammals on our planet are now human beings or oxen or pigs or the livestock that human beings rely on. 70% of all the birds in the world are chickens. In other words, there has been a total or near-total destruction of wildlife. Only 4% of the mammals in the world are now wild mammals, from whales to monkeys, to you name it. That in my view is a disaster. We’re seeing a parallel loss of habitat, of forests and plant species of all kinds. So that’s why the UK is pledged to protect 30% of our land surface, 30% of our marine surface, to create marine protected areas – vast protected areas – which is something by the way an objective that we share very much with France, with Canada – we’re all engaged in this same effort. And of the £11.6 billion that we’ve consecrated to climate finance initiatives, we’re putting £3 billion to protecting nature, whether it’s marine life, or timber conservation or sustainable food production. I think that as global leaders, we must go further and I’m very pleased therefore that so many countries have signed up to the UN Leaders Pledge for Nature so that we have really hard-edged targets for the preservation of species and wildlife, but also the re-wilding of our planet in the way that Sir David Attenborough has suggested. And I would like to see a world in which we give real meaning to those Aichi targets that were set so many years ago at Kyoto and I hope that our Chinese colleagues will be pushing that agenda at their Biodiversity Summit in Kunming. I know that we will be working with colleagues under the auspices of the UN to do that at the COP26 summit in Glasgow. Obviously it’s right to focus on climate change, obviously it’s right to cut CO2 emissions, but we won’t achieve a real balance with our planet unless we protect nature as well. One final thought, don’t forget that the coronavirus pandemic was the product of an imbalance in man’s relationship with the natural world. Like the original plague which struck the Greeks I seem to remember in book one of the Iliad, it is a zoonotic disease. It originates from bats or pangolins, from the demented belief that if you grind up the scales of a pangolin you will somehow become more potent or whatever it is people believe, it originates from this collision between mankind and the natural world and we’ve got to stop it. And that’s why I think that this summit is so important and this focus on the natural world and on biodiversity is absolutely critical. Yes we must tackle climate change, but climate change must be seen as part of an overall agenda to protect the natural world and I think the One Planet agenda is completely right."
"Boris Johnson","Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 15 January 2021","15 January 2021","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-15-january-2021","Prime Minister’s statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 15 January 2021 Good afternoon. As you know, this country is engaged in the biggest and fastest vaccination programme in our history, and the chances are that you know someone personally who has already received a vaccine. But it would be fatal if this sense of progress were now to breed any kind of complacency because the pressures on our NHS are extraordinary. On Tuesday we saw 4,134 new admissions to hospital on a single day, the highest at any point in this pandemic. There are now more than 37,000 Covid patients in hospital across the UK and, in spite of all the efforts of our doctors and nurses and our medical staff, we are now seeing cancer treatments sadly postponed, ambulances queuing, and intensive care units spilling over into adjacent wards. And with 55,761 positive cases since yesterday and, very sadly, 1,280 deaths, this is not the time for the slightest relaxation of our national resolve and our individual efforts. So please stay at home, please protect the NHS and save lives. And please remember that this disease can be passed on not just by standing too near someone in a supermarket queue, but also by handling something touched by an infected person. And remember also that 1 in 3 people with Covid have no symptoms, and that is why that original message of hands, face and space, washing your hands, is as important now as it has ever been. And it is precisely because we have the hope of that vaccine and the risk of new strains coming from overseas that we must take additional steps now to stop those strains from entering the country. So, yesterday we announced that we are banning flights from South America and Portugal. And, to protect us against the risk of as yet unidentified new strains, we will also temporarily close all travel corridors from 0400 on Monday. Following conversations with the devolved administrations, we will act together so that this applies across the whole of UK This means that if you come to this country, you must have proof of a negative Covid test that you have taken in the 72 hours before leaving and you must have filled in your Passenger Locator Form, and your airline will ask for proof of both before you take off. You may also be checked when you land and face substantial fines for refusing to comply And, upon arrival, you must then quarantine for ten days – not leaving your home for any reason at all, or take another test on day 5 and wait for proof of another negative result. And we will be stepping up our enforcement – both at the border and in-country. And it is vital to take these extra measures now when day by day, hour by hour, we are making such strides in protecting the population. We have now vaccinated over 3.2 million people across the UK, doubling the numbers of last week. That’s 2.8 million in England, 225,000 in Scotland, 126,000 in Wales and 115,000 in Northern Ireland. Yesterday alone, we vaccinated around a quarter of a million people in England, and that is still far more than any other country in Europe. And with almost 45 per cent of our over 80s now vaccinated and almost 40 per cent of care home residents, we are steadily protecting those most at risk. And I pay particular tribute to the vaccination efforts going on in Cockermouth, in Cumbria, Yateley and Cheltenham, where they have vaccinated around 90 per cent of their over-80s in their communities. And I’ll also pay tribute to North Lincolnshire, to Sunderland and Morecambe Bay, where vaccination teams have protected over 80 per cent of their care home residents. And it’s thanks to that amazing constellation of the vaccination teams: doctors and nurses armed forces, local authorities, pharmacies and volunteers that we are steadily building up that immunity, that protection for the vulnerable, for the NHS and for us all. So, when the call comes, please do get a jab and, in the meantime, stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives."
"Boris Johnson","Transforming the global energy sector through ambition, collaboration and investment in green recoveries","19 January 2021","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/transforming-the-global-energy-sector-through-ambition-collaboration-and-investment-in-green-recoveries","Excellencies, ladies, and gentlemen. It is an absolute pleasure to join you today. And I would like to thank Mr Francesco La Camera for the fantastic work IRENA is doing under his leadership. Friends, we all know that we must act now on climate change. If we do not, the consequences will be almost unimaginable: With crops failing. Nature devastated. And hundreds of millions threatened by rising seas. To avoid this, it is vital to decarbonise the energy sector, which accounts for around two-thirds of global emissions. And so I am asking governments around the world to do three key things to achieve it. First, raise ambition and action at home. Second, invest in clean recoveries in response to the COVID pandemic. And, third, work together to make progress on our climate ambitions. I am urging all countries to come forward with new Nationally Determined Contributions, and long-term strategies. And to put clear policies in place to achieve them. Policies like improving product efficiency standards. Phasing out coal power. Encouraging decarbonisation in those sectors where it is a challenge. And creating the policy environment to attract private finance. Getting finance flowing, both public and private, is one of my key COP26 priorities. Including urging developed countries to honour the commitment they have made to raise $100 billion a year in international climate finance. I am grateful to IRENA for its work on NDCs and long-term planning. And its support for countries on the clean energy transition. And I am pleased to say that here in the UK, we are acting. We announced a new NDC, consistent with our target to reach net zero by 2050. And last year, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced our ten-point plan for a green industrial revolution. A plan to mobilise £12 billion of government investment. That spurs three times as much from the private sector. A plan to power every home in the country from offshore wind within a decade. And invest in nuclear, hydrogen technologies and Carbon Capture Usage and Storage. A plan which will support and create a quarter of a million jobs. This shows how investment in clean technology can drive our recovery from COVID-19. Which I know has been a focus of IRENA’s work. By aligning our recovery packages with the Paris Agreement, we can help to build clean growth into the heart of our economies. And of course many countries are doing fantastic work to invest in green recoveries. And now we need all leaders to follow suit. We are confident in this approach because we have seen that clean growth is absolutely possible. Over the past thirty years in the UK, we have seen our economy grow by 75 per cent while reducing our emissions by 43 per cent. We have also seen how, by working together, we can make progress faster. By increasing incentives for investment. Creating economies of scale. And accelerating innovation. Solar and wind power costs have fallen by 28% and 15% respectively, each time global deployment has doubled. But we only realise these benefits if we tailor our response to each challenge and sector. That is why international collaboration is one of the key goals of my COP Presidency. Our COP26 campaigns are bringing government, industry, investors, development banks, and civil society together, around five critical areas: Finance, nature, adaptation and resilience, clean transport, and, of course, clean energy. And we have created new forums for collaboration, like the Zero Emission Vehicle Transition Council, and the Energy Transition Council. And I would like to thank everyone involved with this work. Including IRENA, as a member of the COP26 Energy Transition Council. The work of this council includes improving the international support to developing countries to move away from coal. Friends, together, through ambition, collaboration, and investment in green recoveries, we can transform the global energy sector. So let’s take action now, to put the world on track for a clean and prosperous future."
"Boris Johnson","Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 22 January 2021","22 January 2021","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-22-january-2021","Since the beginning of this pandemic, we have tried to update you as soon as possible about changes in the scientific data or the analysis. So, I must tell you this afternoon that we have been informed today that, in addition to spreading more quickly, it also now appears that there is some evidence that the new variant – the variant that was first identified in London and the South East – may be associated with a higher degree of mortality, and I’m going to ask Patrick in a minute to say a bit more about that. Because it is largely the impact of this new variant that means the NHS is under such intense pressure, with another 40,261 positive cases since yesterday. We have 38,562 COVID patients now in hospital, that’s 78 per cent higher than the first peak in April and, tragically, there have been a further 1,401 deaths. So, it is more important than ever that we all remain vigilant in following the rules and that we stay at home, protect the NHS and thereby save lives. But I also want to answer a key question that I know will be uppermost in your minds. All current evidence continues to show that both the vaccines we are currently using remain effective both against the old variant and this new variant. And so, you will also want to know that our immunisation programme continues at an unprecedented rate. 5.4 million people across the UK have now received their first dose of the vaccine and over the last 24 hours we can report a record 400,000 vaccinations. In England one in ten of all adults have received their first dose, including 71 per cent of over-80s and two thirds of elderly care home residents. Having secured orders for hundreds of millions of doses, the U.K. government has supplied vaccines to the Devolved Administrations, according to population size. First doses have been administered now to 151,000 people in Northern Ireland, 358,000 in Scotland and 212,000 in Wales. And I am glad that the whole of the U.K. is able to assist the Devolved Administrations in deploying the vaccine and I know everyone across the country is grateful for the logistical skill of the British Army. There is much more to do, and the target remains very stretching indeed, but we remain on track to reach our goal of offering a first dose to everyone in the top four priority groups by the middle of February. And I want to thank all the doctors and nurses, especially at the GP-led sites who are vaccinating at a phenomenal rate, as well as, as I say, all those in our armed forces, our local authorities, our pharmacies and volunteers, who are making this extraordinary national effort possible. And I want to thank all of you who have come forward to get your jabs, because, by doing that, you are protecting yourselves, your communities and, of course, our NHS. And I say to everyone, when that letter arrives, please don’t hesitate to book that appointment and get this life-saving protection, because this is the best and fastest way for us all to defeat this virus and get our lives back to normal."
"Boris Johnson","Climate Adaptation Summit Talks: launching the Race to Resilience","25 January 2021","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/climate-adaptation-summit-talks-launching-the-race-to-resilience","Thank you very much distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, excellencies. I would really like to thank the Netherlands for hosting this excellent summit. We have heard some brilliant submissions and real power to the messages that have been coming through. I also want to thank the Global Center on Adaptation - I see you have my friend Feike with you. And of course, Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon, for his leadership in adaptation and resilience. And I can tell you that as COP President this is a top priority indeed. And I know that it is the same for my dear friend Patricia Espinosa who you will hear from shortly as well. Building resilience into our economies and societies is absolutely urgent, and it is essential, if we are to protect human lives and livelihoods from the effects of our changing climate. Ultimately it requires all of us to act together: whether it’s governments or cities, or regions; businesses, investors or civil society, all of us have to act on this issue. Of course there is a great deal of fantastic work that is already going on. From cities like Port Moresby, investing in trees and mangroves to protect the City and its people from coastal flooding. To the Coalition for Climate Resilient Investment, which represents around $10 trillion in assets. Driving private finance to fund resilient infrastructure and helping investors to understand climate risk which is so vital. And of course today, we are launching two new campaigns to focus efforts and make progress faster. This morning, as you will have heard, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced the Adaptation Action Coalition. With our partners, Egypt, Bangladesh, Malawi, St Lucia, the UN, and, of course the Netherlands. The Coalition will bring governments together to accelerate action ahead of COP26. And now it is my particular pleasure to launch the Race to Resilience campaign. This is a campaign that will mobilise businesses, investors, cities, civil society and others to act. Bringing together initiatives with the aim of building the resilience of 4 billion people across the world – that’s representing over half of the world’s population – by 2030. The campaign will support activities delivering for people and nature. For example, cities protecting people against heatwaves. Or small holder farmers utilising climate resilient technologies. And restoring deforested and degraded land. I would also like to thank our two brilliant Climate Champions, Nigel and Gonzalo, for the incredible effort that they have put in to make sure that this initiative happens. And I do think that together, these two campaigns can make a real difference to the scale and pace of adaptation and resilience across all our economies and indeed across society. So I will finish with an ask to everyone who is listening and watching this: the ask to governments, is please join the Adaptation Action Coalition; and to businesses, to cities, to civil society groups, please join the Race to Resilience. And help us, working together, to build a more resilient and better world. Thank you."
"Boris Johnson","Climate Adaptation for Resilience","26 January 2021","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/climate-adaptation-for-resilience","A huge thank you to the World Economic Forum and the Netherlands for organising this panel. And to my fellow panel members for their brilliant insight. 2021 is indeed going to be a critical year for the climate. And I want to see the golden thread of climate action woven through every international event on the road to Glasgow. At the Climate Ambition Summit, which the UK co-hosted with the UN and France last December, we had 75 world leaders come forward to make concrete commitments. I set out four key priorities of COP26. First, to secure a step change in emissions reductions which we all want to see. Second, to strengthen adaptation, protecting people and nature. Third, to get finance flowing to climate action. Both public and private finance. And fourth, to enhance international cooperation on this issue. Among policy makers, investors, business and civil society. Today, I want to focus on the last three of these priorities. And how they work together. The reality is the effects of climate change are already with us. So it is vital that we go further and faster on adaptation. We need to build resilience into our societies and economies. That requires action from us all: governments, cities, investors, business, and civil society. The human and economic case is absolutely overwhelming. We know that the most vulnerable are at the greatest risk from climate change. Those that have done the least to cause it. Time and again we have seen the devastation and human misery wracked by storms, droughts and rising sea levels. We know that without sufficient action, millions will lose their lives and livelihoods. And many millions will be pushed very sadly into poverty. We’ve heard from the Global Centre for Adaptation, that every dollar spent on adaptation, yields between two and ten times that in avoided costs and damages. So as COP26 President, I am calling on leaders in all sectors to up their ambition and action on adaptation. I am urging countries to come forward with ambitious adaptation plans and communications. As the UK did last month. I am encouraging governments to align their recovery packages with the Paris Agreement, and the Sustainable Development Goals. And, I am asking business, cities, civil society and more to join the Race to Resilience campaign, which we launched yesterday to increase ambition on resilience across society. The UK is also helping to find practical solutions on adaptation. Launching the Adaptation Research Alliance last week, to do just that. And proudly supporting LIFE-AR. A programme led by the least developed countries to aid their adaptation. Because we are committed to adaptation being locally led. And to making progress faster through international collaboration. That is why, yesterday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson launched the Adaptation Action Coalition. With our partners, Egypt, Bangladesh, Malawi, St Lucia, the UN, and the Netherlands. Critically, we are also working with donors, development banks, and private investors to get adaptation and resilience finance flowing faster and stronger, particularly to developing countries. With organisations like the Coalition for Climate Resilient Investment, for example, and through that we are encouraging investors to take climate risk into account in every decision. Last year we launched an initiative to accelerate investment in adaptation and resilience through Development Finance Institutions – which I urge other DFIs to join. I am also urging donors to significantly increase international climate finance commitments and ensure a balance between adaptation and mitigation. We need to ensure that not only must donor countries honour that totemic USD 100 billion pledge. But adaptation should no longer be regarded as the poor cousin to mitigation when it comes to finance flows. I believe, if we get finance moving. If we work together. And if we have the ambition and support to act. We can increase the scale and the pace of our adaptation. And by that we will protect our people, our natural environment, and our economies. Thank you."

And I am acutely conscious that at this moment, parents are balancing the demands of working from home with supporting the education of their children, businesspeople are enduring the sight of their shops or restaurants or other enterprises standing empty and idle and, sadly, too many are coping with the anxiety of illness or tragedy of bereavement. I am deeply sorry to say that the number of people that have taken from us has surpassed 100,000, as the house was discussing only an hour or so ago, and I know the House will join me in offering condolences to all those who have lost loved ones. The most important thing we can do to honour their memory is to persevere against this virus with ever greater resolve, and that is why we have launched the biggest vaccination programme in British history. Three weeks ago, I reported that the UK had immunised 1.3 million people; now that figure has multiplied more than fivefold to exceed 6.8 million people, more than any other country in Europe and over 13 per cent of the entire adult population. In England we have now delivered first doses to over four-fifths of those aged 80 or over, and over half of those aged between 75 and 79 and three quarters of elderly care home residents And though it remains an exacting target, we are on track to achieve our goal of offering a first dose to everyone in the top four priority groups by the middle of February. I can also reassure the House that all current evidence shows that both the vaccines we are administering remain effective against the new variant that was first identified in London and the South East by means of our world-leading capability in genomic sequencing. The UK has now sequenced over half of all COVID-19 viral genomes that have been submitted to the global database, 10 times more than any other country. And yesterday, my Rt Hon Friend the Health Secretary announced our New Variant Assessment Platform, through which we will work with the World Health Organisation to offer our expertise to help other countries, because a new variant anywhere poses a potential threat everywhere. To guard against this danger, we must also take additional steps to strengthen our borders to stop those strains from entering the UK. We have already temporarily closed all travel corridors and we are already requiring anyone coming to this country to have proof of a negative Covid test taken in the 72 hours before leaving. They must also complete a Passenger Locator Form which must be checked before they board - and then quarantine on arrival for ten days. I want to make clear that under the stay at home regulations it is illegal to leave home to travel abroad for leisure purposes and we will enforce this at ports and airports by asking people why they are leaving and instructing them to return home if they do not have a valid reason to travel. We have also banned all travel from 22 countries where there is a risk of known variants including South Africa, Portugal and South American nations, and in order to reduce the risk posed by UK nationals and residents returning home from these countries,I can announce that we will require all such arrivals who cannot be refused entry to isolate in government-provided accommodation - such as hotels - for ten days without exception. They will be met at the airport and transported directly into quarantine. The Department for Health and Social Care is working to establish these facilities as quickly as possible and my Rt Hon Friend the Home Secretary will set out the details of our plans in her statement shortly. My Rt Hon Friend the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster has this morning spoken to the First Ministers of Scotland and Wales, and the First and deputy First Ministers of Northern Ireland and, as we have throughout the pandemic, we will be working closely with the DAs to implement these new measures so that, where possible, we continue to take a UK-wide approach. Mr Speaker, it was the emergence of a new variant – up to 70 per cent more transmissible – that forced England back into lockdown, and I know everyone yearns to know how much longer we must endure these restrictions, with all their consequences for jobs, livelihoods and most tragically of all, the life chances of our children. We will not persist for a day longer than is necessary, but nor can we relax too soon, because if we do we run the risk of our NHS coming under still greater pressure, compelling us to re-impose every restriction and sustain those restrictions for longer. So far, our efforts do appear to have reduced the R rate, but we do not yet have enough data to know exactly how soon it will be safe to reopen our society and economy. At this point, we do not have enough data to judge the full effect of vaccines in blocking transmission nor the extent and speed with which the vaccines will reduce hospitalisations and deaths, nor how quickly the combination of vaccinations and the lockdown can be expected to ease the pressure on the NHS. What we do know is that we remain in a perilous situation, with more than 37,000 patients now in hospital with Covid, almost double the peak of the first wave. But the overall picture should be clearer by mid-February: by then, we will know much more about the effect of vaccines in preventing hospitalisations and deaths, using data from the UK but also other nations like Israel. We will know how successful the current restrictions have been in driving down infections. We will also know how many people are still in hospital with Covid, which we simply can’t predict with certainty today. So we will then be in a better position to chart a course out of lockdown, without risking a further surge that would overwhelm the NHS. When I announced the lockdown I said we would review its measures in mid-February, once the most vulnerable had been offered the first dose of the vaccine. So I can tell the House that when Parliament returns from Recess in the week commencing 22nd February subject to the full agreement of the House, Mr Speaker, we intend to set out the results of that review and publish our plan for taking the country out of lockdown. That plan will, of course, depend on the continued success of our vaccination programme, the capacity of the NHS, and on deaths falling at the pace we would expect as more people are inoculated. Our aim will be to set out a gradual and phased approach towards easing the restrictions in a sustainable way, guided by the principles we have observed throughout the pandemic, beginning with the most important principle of all: that re-opening schools must be our national priority and the first sign of normality beginning to return should be pupils going back to their classrooms. I know how parents and teachers need as much certainty as possible, including two weeks’ notice of the return of face-to-face teaching. So I must inform the House that, for the reasons I have outlined, it will not be possible to re-open schools immediately after the February half term. I know how frustrating that will be for pupils and teachers who want nothing more than to get back in the classroom and for parents and carers who have spent so many months juggling their day jobs not only with home schooling but with meeting the myriad other demands of their children from breakfast until bedtime. And I know too the worries we all share about the mental health of our young people during this prolonged period of being stuck at home. So our plan for leaving the lockdown will set out our approach towards re-opening schools. If we achieve our target of vaccinating everyone in the four most vulnerable groups with their first dose by 15 February – and every passing day sees more progress towards that goal – then those groups will have developed immunity from the virus by about three weeks later, that is by 8 March. We hope it will therefore be safe to commence the reopening of schools from Monday 8 March, with other economic and social restrictions being removed thereafter as and when the data permits – then or thereafter, I should say, Mr Speaker. As we are extending the period of remote learning beyond the middle of February, I can confirm that the government will prolong arrangements for providing free school meals for those eligible children not in school – including food parcels and the national voucher scheme – until they have returned to the classroom. We can also commit now that, as we did this financial year, we will provide a programme of catch up over the next financial year. This will involve a further £300m of new money to schools for tutoring and we will work in collaboration with the education sector to develop, as appropriate, specific initiatives for summer schools and a Covid Premium to support catch up. But we recognise that these extended school closures have had a huge impact on children’s learning which will take more than a year to make up. So we will work with parents, teachers and schools to develop a long-term plan to make sure pupils have the chance to make up their learning over the course of this Parliament. I know, Mr Speaker, that the measures I am setting out today will be deeply frustrating to many honourable friends and colleagues, and disappointing for all of us. But the way forward has been clear ever since the vaccines arrived and, as we inoculate more people hour by hour, this is the time to hold our nerve in the endgame of the battle against the virus. Our goal now must be to buy the extra weeks we need to immunise the most vulnerable and get this virus under control, so that together we can defeat this most wretched disease, reclaim our lives once and for all, and, Mr Speaker, I commend this statement to the House."
"Boris Johnson","Raising ambition to tackle climate change in Latin America and the Caribbean","2 February 2021","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/raising-ambition-to-tackle-climate-change-in-latin-america-and-the-caribbean","Friends, good afternoon from London. It is a real pleasure to join you all today for these incredibly important discussions. I want to thank you for the great climate action we that have already seen from so many of you in the region. So, if I take some examples. We’ve had ambitious new Nationally Determined Contributions from Chile, Colombia, Jamaica, Costa Rica and many others. And as well as the commitment from Barbados to go fossil fuel free within the decade. And I am really enormously grateful to all of you who made announcements at the Climate Ambition Summit in December. And really showcased climate leadership at the CARICOM Moment of Ambition event the day before. But of course, we have much more to do collectively. Now, we must build on the momentum that’s being created. I think we all recognise this is an absolutely vital year for our planet. We know – because the science tells us- that the world must halve its emissions over the next decade if we are to limit global temperatures in line with the Paris Agreement. We also know that if we continue on our current course we will unleash catastrophe, putting this region’s stunning biodiversity, its countries, its small island states vulnerable to climate change in much more peril. And we know that we must rapidly increase our efforts to adapt and build our resilience. So, COP26 must genuinely be the moment that countries, and companies, and cities and regions, all of us collectively, unite behind the Paris Agreement. And it is all about putting the world on track to make Paris a reality. In this, the UK’s COP26 Presidency looks to our Latin American and Caribbean friends for support and action. And I request and I ask that you to work together, and with international partners, throughout this year, to explore the key issues in the negotiations. And to engage with the events convened by the UK and Chile COP Presidencies, to help make progress on the UNFCCC process. In this, environment ministers play an absolutely vital role. And the UK’s Embassies and the COP26 Regional Ambassador Fiona, stand ready to support you. And urge you to come forward with robust adaptation plans and communications, and to announce net zero targets, with NDCs and long-term strategies to take you there. And clear policies and plans to make these targets a reality. Given this region’s unique biodiversity, action on nature is particularly important. This is another priority for our COP26 Presidency. And I thank all of you who have been involved with today’s Forest, Agriculture and Commodity Trade Dialogues, and encourage all of you to look at the Dasgupta Review – published today – talking about the economics of biodiversity. Finally, I ask you to seize the opportunities presented by the move to clean, resilient growth, by aligning your own Covid-19 recovery packages with the Paris Agreement. I do recognise that this region has been particularly hard hit by the pandemic. But it is by investing in clean recoveries today, that we support jobs and growth, both now and in the future. Let me give you an example: wind and solar now cost less than fossil fuels in two thirds of countries. And that trend is continuing will undercut commissioned coal and gas almost everywhere by 2030, And we also know from the International Renewable Energy Agency that by boosting renewables investment we could have an extra 7 million more jobs worldwide, compared to if we continued on a business as usual track. Here in the UK we have demonstrated that green growth is absolutely possible. Over the past 30 years we have managed to grow our economy by 75 per cent whilst cutting our emissions 43 per cent. And last year, our Prime Minister launched a plan for a Green Industrial Revolution, to support a quarter of a million jobs and help drive our recovery. This places climate action at the heart of our plans for the economy. So, I encourage all of you here today to work with your Ministries of Finance to do the same. Because collaborative working across each government is going to deliver what we all want. And I urge you to work to support green recoveries around the world. And of course, the UK COP26 Presidency is also working to get finance flowing. We are working the MDBs - multilateral development banks - with private investors to drive investment. Particularly to vulnerable countries. And with a particular focus on adaptation. And I am very much calling very loudly on donor countries to raise the $100 billion a year in international climate finance that has been promised and is a matter of trust for so many. The UK government itself has doubled its own contribution to £11.6 billion over five years. And £3bn of that, some days ago Prime Minister Johnson announced, will go to nature. Friends, in conclusion, the Paris Agreement gave us a wonderful framework to address the threat of climate change. To make it a reality, we must now step up. Raise our ambition, take action. And seize the opportunities presented to build a clean and sustainable recovery that we all want to see and that our people absolutely deserve. Thank you."
"Boris Johnson","Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 3 February 2021","3 February 2021","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-3-february-2021","Good afternoon, When Captain Sir Tom Moore decided to launch a national campaign in his own back garden raising more money and achieving more in his one hundredth year than perhaps any Centenarian in our history he knew instinctively which organisation he wanted to thank and support it was – and is – the NHS. And he was right. Because there are many people and groups responsible for the UK’s vaccination programme and we owe our thanks to our brilliant scientists, to Kate Bingham and the Vaccine Task Force which has procured over 400 million doses of seven different types of vaccine, to the manufacturers and the delivery drivers, the pharmacists, the military medics, countless volunteers, but to get this life-saving medicine into the arms of the nation at the kind of speed that we’re seeing we are relying on the doctors, nurses and all the staff of our NHS. And it is thanks to their effort – the most colossal in the history of our National Health Service - that we have today passed the milestone of 10 million vaccinations in the United Kingdom, including almost 90 per cent of those aged 75 and over in England and every eligible person in a care home. And with every jab and every day, we have more evidence about the effectiveness of these vaccines. New research from Oxford University suggests the protection provided by the first dose of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine kicks in after three weeks and lasts right the way through to the booster at three months. And research also shows that the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine seems likely to reduce transmission to others. And even if these vaccines cannot make us invulnerable, and no vaccine has ever given 100 per cent protection to everybody the evidence increasingly shows that our vaccines achieve this crucial objective: to reduce death and serious illness from those major strains of Covid that have been subject to research. And in the days leading up to our review point in the week of the 15th of February we will be accumulating even more data helped by NHS Test and Trace – so that we can begin to chart a way ahead starting, if the data allow, with the re-opening of schools on March 8th. And I will be setting out as much as we can about that roadmap forward on February 22nd And though today there are some signs of hope the numbers of Covid patients in hospital are beginning to fall for the first time since the onset of this new wave - the level of infection is still alarmingly high. And I am sorry to say that we have lost another 1,322 lives in the last 24 hours alone and our hearts again go out to every family that grieves. And the wards of our NHS are under huge pressure with more than 32,000 Covid patients still in hospital. And so tonight let’s clap together for Captain Tom at 6pm and let’s clap for the spirit of optimism that he stood for but let’s also clap for all those he campaigned for our brilliant NHS staff and care workers and let’s do everything we can to carry on supporting them. Because if we stay at home, protect our NHS and save lives, then in the words of Captain Tom - tomorrow will be a good day."
"Boris Johnson","COP26 President addresses UN Member States","8 February 2021","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/cop26-president-addresses-un-member-states","Excellencies, Secretary General, friends. It is a real pleasure to speak to you all again to provide this regular update. And as you all know I am now devoting all of my time and energies to the role of COP26 President Designate, whilst continuing as a full member of the UK Government Cabinet. I hope this tells you how seriously Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the whole of the UK Government are taking our role as incoming COP Presidency. It recognises the stark facts in front of us. The facts as the Secretary General has just outlined. And the urgent need to increase our collective ambition across all elements of the Paris Agreement. 2020 saw record temperatures. We saw fires raging across the world. We saw storms intensifying. In short, my friends, the climate crisis is closing in. But, as the Secretary General noted, we are seeing some acceleration in climate action despite the pandemic, and of course at the Climate Ambition Summit the UK held with the UN and France in December, we heard from 75 leaders. Who announced between them 45 Nationally Determined Contributions, 24 net zero pledges, and 20 adaptation commitments. With many of the countries most vulnerable to climate change leading the way. So I want to thank you, every one of you, who took part. By the end of 2020, net zero was firmly established as the norm. If you take into account President Biden’s recent announcements, over half of G20 countries and around 70 per cent of global emissions are now covered by net zero targets. And I hope I speak for all of us when I say: welcome back to the USA in our shared fight against climate change. As I said at the Climate Ambition Summit. All this commitment is welcome. But it is not enough to meet the ambitions of the Paris Agreement. Ambitions which we have collectively agreed. So let’s be frank with ourselves, we still have some way to go. We are, as the Secretary General said, way off target. We need to do more, and we need to do it urgently. So, in my speech to the Summit, I outlined four goals, I want us to work towards together, to get the world on track to make Paris a reality. Today, I want to say a bit more about how we can do so. First, we need to secure that step change in emissions reductions. We all know what we need to do here: This isn’t new. This is about net zero targets; with aligned NDCs that keep that 1.5 degrees within reach; and policies like phasing-out coal power, to show that we are serious. Secondly, we must strengthen adaptation. I really welcome the Secretary General’s leadership here. And the Climate Adaptation Summit, held by the Netherlands last month. Where the UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson launched the new Adaptation Action Coalition. This has been developed by the UK, and our friends in Egypt, Bangladesh, Malawi, the Netherlands, Saint Lucia and the UN. With our Group of Friends on Adaptation and Resilience in New York. The aim is to convert the political commitment generated through the Call to Action – which I was part of launching in 2019, at UNCAS – into practical reality. I urge all countries to join this Coalition. Please sign the Call to Action if you have not already done so. As well as to focus on effective adaptation planning and setting out progress in Adaptation Communications. Our third goal - a vital one - is to get finance flowing – both public and private. Particularly to developing countries. And especially to adaptation. My message could not be clearer. Progress on public finance has sadly been too slow. Woefully slow, say our friends in countries on the frontline of having to deal with climate change. My fellow donor countries need to step-up and deliver the $100 billion a year in international climate finance that we have promised. As I’ve said before, this is a matter of trust and we must deliver. Last month, the UK COP Presidency published our public finance priorities. We want to work with all of you to make progress on these vital issues. And I am also working to get both public and private finance moving. And to make further progress in this area, the UK’s COP26 Presidency will hold a Climate and Development Ministerial at the end of March. We will bring together Ministers representing donor countries and countries vulnerable to climate change. To establish how we can remove barriers to climate action and development. Together, we will look at four vital issues: access to finance; quantity & predictability of finance; the response to impacts; and fiscal space and debt. And we will plan how to make progress on each of these areas, through events like the G7, IFI Spring Meetings, and the UN General Assembly. Discussions will be informed by experts and civil society groups. We will be working with regional chairs to make sure all regions are represented. The event will also be open to observers from countries who are not directly participating. The fourth and final goal is to enhance international collaboration around critical challenges and sectors. To make progress faster. Our COP26 campaigns have established new forums. Like the Energy Transition Council, and the Zero Emission Vehicle Transition Council. Which met for the first time last year. We also have the Forest, Agriculture and Commodity Trade Dialogues, which were launched publicly last week. And I have to say we have seen a real appetite for cooperation. So I thank all countries involved. On all of these four goals, major economies must show leadership. Let me confirm to you that the UK will use its G7 Presidency to urge them to do so, as our Italian partners will with their G20 presidency. Of course, the multilateral negotiations are at the heart of our plans. They underpin each of the four goals I have outlined, and are absolutely key to fulfilling the Paris Agreement. We must test solutions, and prepare the ground, ahead of COP26, so that we arrive in Glasgow ready to close a deal. Last year, we did make progress virtually despite the pandemic. We had events like the UN Climate Change Dialogues and others. But this year cannot simply be a repeat of the last. As the Secretary General has outlined, we may not all be able to meet in person for some months. But we know that we need to make progress faster. And so we need to seek creative ways of conducting our discussions that have inclusivity at their heart. I am therefore consulting with the chairs of all the UNFCCC negotiating groups. And meeting international partners. To understand their positions. As Ambassador Woodward pointed out, I have recently visited Ethiopia and Gabon and I will continue to travel where possible. With our friends in Chile, we have initiated new monthly meetings, bringing together Heads of Delegation from every country, to chart the course to Glasgow together and to find possible solutions to negotiating issues. Friends, I have to say this: this is a joint endeavour. An endeavour between all of us together. So we are working with the UNFCCC to support parties’ connectivity. We are holding meetings at times that respect different time zones. And we are discussing how technology can help us move forward together. We must continue to work creatively and flexibly, guided by the principles of transparency, inclusivity and common purpose, to make progress which is so vital. So that when we do meet in person in November, we secure an outcome that delivers for each and every country. And that delivers for our planet as a whole. And I look forward to working with all of you throughout 2021 to achieve this. We all know what is at stake if we do not work now to secure the right outcomes at Glasgow. Let me remind you: we have 266 days to go to COP26. Please, let’s work together. Let’s make sure that every one of those days counts."

"Boris Johnson","Prime Minister's statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 10 February 2021","10 February 2021","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-10-february-2021","It is five weeks since we set ourselves the target of vaccinating almost 15 million of the most vulnerable people in the country, and the aim was – and is – clear to everyone. By offering the prospect of protection from Covid to everyone 70 and over, to all frontline NHS and care staff, to older care home residents and staff and to all those who are clinically extremely vulnerable, we can do the most, the fastest, to reduce the incidence of death and serious illness. And, with less than a week to go until the target date of Monday 15th, there is no doubt that we have made great strides, with just over 13 million people now vaccinated in our United Kingdom, including 1 in 4 adults in England, over 90 per cent of everyone over 75 and over 90 per cent of eligible residents of care homes for the elderly. But that still leaves nearly 2 million people – a population roughly twice the size of Birmingham – that we still hope to reach. And there are people across the country who for one reason or another haven’t yet taken up their offer. So now is the moment to do it, wherever you are – you won’t be more than about 10 miles away from a vaccination centre. So, go online, or get someone to help you or simply pick up the phone and call 119. And let me appeal to the fantastic social care workers we all rely on to look after our relatives, our parents and grandparents. If you have not received a letter, please contact your employer and fix it up. And let me stress that these vaccines are safe and effective, and it was good to see the World Health Organisation today confirm its support for the Oxford/Astra Zeneca vaccine for use in everyone over the age of 18 and, obviously, anyone over 65, and also supporting the 12-week interval between the two doses. Indeed, they say the longer interval provides greater protection. And the reason I make this appeal today, for people to come forward in those groups and get vaccinated, is not so we hit some numerical target, but to save lives, prevent serious illness, and so the whole country can take another step on a long and hard road back to normality. And, as the data comes in, I’ll be saying more about that – including setting out the roadmap – over the next two weeks. I think the people of this country absolutely understand the importance of protecting the most vulnerable first and that is what we are doing. And, if we can keep the pace up and keep the supplies of vaccines up, we hope to reach everyone in cohorts 1 to 9 by the end of April. And I want to thank all of those involved for their heroic efforts: the doctors, nurses, military medics, local authorities, transport planners, warehouse operatives, delivery drivers, countless volunteers, often working through the night or even digging out snowed-in vaccination centres, like the community effort at Alwoodley Medical Centre in Leeds last Saturday so GPs, nurses and their teams could deliver 1,200 doses that day. And I want to thank the millions of people who have received their vaccinations and, with cases still high and the pressures on our NHS still severe, I want finally thank everyone, all of you who are continuing to follow the rules and urge you once again to stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives. Thank you."
"Boris Johnson","Prime Minister's speech at the Munich Security Conference: 19 February 2021","19 February 2021","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-speech-at-the-munich-security-conference-19-february-2021","There is a habit of turning up at occasions such as these and announcing portentously that the West is locked in terminal decline, the Atlantic alliance is fractured, and NATO is in peril, and everything we hold dear risks being cast into oblivion. And that industry of pessimism has thrived recently, perhaps even in Munich. So without wishing for a moment to downplay the challenges and dangers we face, in the teeth of a global pandemic, let me respectfully suggest that the gloom has been overdone and we are turning a corner, and the countries we call the “West” are drawing together and combining their formidable strengths and expertise once again, immensely to everybody’s benefit. As you’ve seen and heard earlier, America is unreservedly back as leader of the free world and that is a fantastic thing. And it’s vital for our American friends to know that their allies on this side of the Atlantic are willing and able to share the risks and the burdens of addressing the world’s toughest problems That is why Global Britain is there and that is exactly what Global Britain is striving to achieve. I’m delighted to report that I detected precisely that willingness among my fellow G7 leaders when I chaired a virtual meeting earlier today. The shared goals of the UK’s presidency of the G7 are to help the world to build back better and build back greener after the pandemic and minimise the risk of a catastrophe like this happening again. We all have lessons to learn from an experience that none of us would want to repeat. At the last UN General Assembly, I proposed a five-point plan to protect the world against future pandemics and today the G7 agreed to explore a Treaty on Pandemic Preparedness, working through the World Health Organization, which would enshrine the actions that countries need to take to safeguard everyone against another Covid. I intend to bring together my fellow leaders, scientists and international organisations for collective defence against the next pathogen, just as we unite against military threats. The heroic endeavours of the world’s scientists produced safe and effective vaccines against Covid in barely 300 days. In future we should aim to telescope that even more: by drawing together our resources, we should seek to develop vaccines against emerging diseases in 100 days. Even in the early weeks of the pandemic, I hope that we in the UK resisted the temptations of a sauve qui peut approach and tried to keep the flame of global cooperation alive. We helped to establish COVAX, the global alliance to bring Covid vaccines to developing countries, and today Britain ranks among COVAX’s biggest donors, with the aim of supplying a billion doses to 92 nations, and we will also share the majority of any surplus from our domestic vaccination programme. When Oxford University and AstraZeneca began their momentous effort against Covid, their express aim was to design a vaccine that would be cheap to obtain and easy to store, so that it could be speedily administered by every country. Protecting ourselves also means tracking the virus’s mutations, and nearly half of all the genome sequencing of possible Covid variants, anywhere in the world, has taken place in the UK. Now we need to mobilise our shared expertise to create an early warning system for the next pathogen, enabled by a worldwide network of pandemic surveillance centres, and the UK intends work alongside the WHO and our friends to bring this about. If anything good can possibly come from this tragedy, we have at least been given the chance to build a global recovery on new and green foundations, so that humanity can prosper without imperilling the planet. To that end, as you’ve just been hearing from John Kerry, Britain will host COP-26 in Glasgow in November and I’m delighted that America under President Biden’s leadership has rejoined the Paris Agreement. The UK’s aim will be to help to rally as many countries as possible behind the target of Net Zero by 2050. We were the first industrialised nation to adopt this goal and we have made it legally binding and published our plan for a Green Industrial Revolution to show how we will get there, so I hope that other countries will follow the UK’s example. But we can only address global problems alongside our friends, and extend Britain’s influence around the world, if the UK itself and our own citizens are safe, including from the terrorist threat we all face. The starting point of our Integrated Review of foreign, defence and development policy – which will be published next month – is that the success of Global Britain depends on the security of our homeland and the stability of the Euro-Atlantic area. If climate change and pandemics are silent and insidious threats, hostile states may seek to harm our people in direct and obvious ways, as the Russian state did with reckless abandon in Salisbury three years ago, only to collide with the immovable rock of trans-Atlantic solidarity, sanctions and coordinated diplomatic expulsions, an outstanding act of collective security, for which I once again thank our friends. If we are to assure our safety, our democracies need to strengthen their capabilities to meet the rigours of an ever more competitive world. And it is precisely for that reason, so that we can keep our people safe, by fulfilling our obligations to NATO and enhancing the UK’s global influence, that is the reason I have decided to bolster our armed forces with the biggest increase in our defence budget since the Cold War. The UK’s defence spending will rise by £24 billion over the next four years, comfortably exceeding the NATO pledge to invest 2 percent of GDP, and ensuring that we retain the biggest defence budget in Europe and the second largest in NATO, after the United States. We will focus our investment on the new technologies that will revolutionise warfare – artificial intelligence, unmanned aircraft, directed energy weapons and many others – so that we stand alongside our allies to deter any adversary and preserve the peace. This year, the Royal Navy’s new aircraft carrier, HMS Queen Elizabeth, will embark on her maiden deployment, sailing 20,000 nautical miles to the Indo-Pacific and back. On her flight deck will be a squadron of F35 jets from the US Marine Corps; among her escorts will be an American destroyer, showing how the British and American armed forces can operate hand-in-glove - or plane-on-flightdeck - anywhere in the world. But investing in new capabilities is not an end in itself. The purpose of the military instrument is to strengthen diplomacy and therefore maximise the chances of success. We do not wish to live in a world of unchecked rivalry or decoupling or obstacles to sensible cooperation and global economic growth. Nor are we concerned solely with trade: I hope the UK has shown by our actions that we will defend our values as well as our interests. In leaving the European Union we restored sovereign control over vital levers of foreign policy. For the first time in nearly 50 years, we now have the power to impose independent national sanctions, allowing the UK to act swiftly and robustly. Our first decision was to create a Magnitsky regime designed to punish human rights offenders. The UK then became the first European country to sanction senior figures in Belarus after the stolen election. We have now imposed sanctions on over 50 human rights violators, including from Russia, Myanmar and Zimbabwe. We have consistently spoken out against China’s repression of the Uighur people in Xinjiang province - and we will continue to do so. We have introduced new measures to ensure that the supply chains of UK companies are not tainted by the violations in Xinjiang. After China broke a treaty and imposed a repressive national security law on Hong Kong, the UK offered nearly 3 million of the territory’s people a route to British citizenship. We acted quickly and willingly – with cross-party support at home – to keep faith with the people of Hong Kong. Now that we have left the EU, Parliament has a greater say over foreign policy and this has only reinforced our national determination to be a Force for Good in the world. Britain is working alongside France, Germany and the United States in a trans-Atlantic quad to address the most pressing security issues, including Iran. And I sense a new resolve among our European friends and allies to come together and act again with unity and determination, and we witnessed that spirit after the attempted murder of Alexei Navalny, as he recovered in a hospital bed in Berlin. While NATO was being written-off in some places, the supertanker of European defence spending was quietly beginning to turn, and while this delicate high seas manoeuvre is far from complete, and the vessel needs to alter course a good deal more, the fact is that NATO defence spending – excluding the United States – has risen by $190 billion since the Wales summit in 2014. When our allies on the eastern flank sought reassurance about their security, NATO responded by deploying a multinational force in Poland and the Baltic states and the UK was proud to make the biggest single contribution, leading the battlegroup in Estonia, showing that we mean it when we say that our commitment to European security is unconditional and immoveable. I believe that Europe increasingly recognises the necessity of joining our American friends to rediscover that far-sighted leadership and the spirit of adventure and trans-Atlantic unity, that made our two continents great in the first place. A new world is rising up around us, patterns of trade and commerce are changing, the global centre of gravity is moving eastwards, the technological revolution proceeds with blistering speed. But none of us should fear or resent these changes. Free societies are united by their faith in liberal democracy, the rule of law and free markets, which surely comprise the great trinity of human progress. Free countries – many of them located far beyond the geographical “West”, by the way – possess a boundless and inherent ability to release the talents and enterprise of their people to master and adapt to change. It is no coincidence that of the 10 most innovative nations in the world – as ranked by the Global Innovation Index in 2020 – all but one are liberal democracies. There is no reason why our countries should not be stronger and safer in 2030 – or indeed 2050 – than today, provided we share the burdens, compete successfully and seek out friends and partners wherever they may be found. I have invited South Korea, and Australia and India to attend the next G7 summit as guests, alongside leading international organisations. So let’s resist any temptation to bemoan the changes around us. Let’s build a coalition for openness and innovation, reaching beyond established alliances and the confines of geography, proud of our history, but free of any temptation to turn back the clock, and harnessing the genius of open societies to flourish in an era of renewed competition. Let’s respectfully dispel the air of pessimism that has sometimes attended our conferences. America and Europe, side by side, have the ability to prove once again the innate advantages of free nations, and to succeed in forging our own destiny."
"Boris Johnson","PM statement to the House of Commons on roadmap for easing lockdown restrictions in England: 22 February 2021","21 February 2021","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-statement-to-the-house-of-commons-on-roadmap-for-easing-lockdown-restrictions-in-england-22-february-2021","Mr Speaker, with permission, I will make a Statement on the roadmap that will guide us cautiously but irreversibly – towards reclaiming our freedoms while doing all we can to protect our people against Covid. Today’s measures will apply in England, but we are working closely with the Devolved Administrations who are setting out similar plans. The threat remains substantial, with the numbers in hospital only now beginning to fall below the peak of the first wave in April. But we are able to take these steps because of the resolve of the British public and the extraordinary success of our NHS in vaccinating more than 17.5 million people across the UK. The data so far suggests both vaccines are effective against the dominant strains of Covid. Public Health England has found that one dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine reduces hospitalisations and deaths by at least 75 per cent. And early data suggests that the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine provides a good level of protection, though since we only started deploying this vaccine last month, at this stage the size of its effect is less certain. But no vaccine can ever be 100 per cent effective, nor will everyone take them up, and like all viruses, Covid-19 will mutate. So, as the modelling released by SAGE today shows, we cannot escape the fact that lifting lockdown will result in more cases, more hospitalisations and sadly more deaths. This would happen whenever lockdown is lifted, whether now or in six or nine months, because there will always be some vulnerable people who are not protected by the vaccine. There is therefore no credible route to a Zero Covid Britain or indeed a Zero Covid World and we cannot persist indefinitely with restrictions that debilitate our economy, our physical and mental well-being, and the life-chances of our children. And that is why it is so crucial that this roadmap should be cautious but also irreversible. We are setting out on what I hope and believe is a one way road to freedom. And this journey is made possible by the pace of the vaccination programme. In England, everyone in the top four priority groups was successfully offered a vaccine by the middle of February. We now aim to offer a first dose to all those in groups 5 to 9 by 15 April, and I am setting another stretching target: to offer a first dose to every adult by the end of July. As more of us are inoculated, so the protection afforded by the vaccines will gradually replace the restrictions and today’s roadmap sets out the principles of that transition. The level of infection is broadly similar across England, so we will ease restrictions in all areas at the same time. The sequence will be driven by the evidence, so outdoor activity will be prioritised as the best way to restore freedoms while minimising the risk. At every stage, our decisions will be led by data not dates, and subjected to four tests. First, that the vaccine deployment programme continues successfully; second, that evidence shows vaccines are sufficiently effective in reducing hospitalisations and deaths; third, that infection rates do not risk a surge in hospitalisations which would put unsustainable pressure on the NHS; and fourth, that our assessment of the risks is not fundamentally changed by new variants of Covid that cause concern. Before taking each step we will review the data against these tests and because it takes at least four weeks for the data to reflect the impact of relaxations in restrictions and we want to give the country a week’s notice before each change - there will be at least five weeks between each step. The Chief Medical Officer is clear that moving any faster would mean acting before we know the impact of each step, which would increase the risk of us having to reverse course and re-impose restrictions. I won’t take that risk. Step one will happen from 8 March, by which time those in the top four priority groups will be benefiting from the increased protection they receive from their first dose of their vaccine. Mr Speaker, all the evidence shows that classrooms are the best places for our young people to be. That’s why I’ve always said that schools would be the last to close and the first to reopen. And based on our assessment of the current data against the four tests, I can tell the House that two weeks’ from today pupils and students in all schools and further education settings can safely return to face-to-face teaching, supported by twice-weekly testing of secondary school and college pupils. Families and childcare bubbles will also be encouraged to get tested regularly. Breakfast and afterschool clubs can also re-open - and other children’s activities, including sport, can restart where necessary to help parents to work. Students on university courses requiring practical teaching, specialist facilities or onsite assessments will also return but all others will need to continue learning online, and we will review the options for when they can return by the end of the Easter Holidays. From 8 March, people will also be able to meet one person from outside their household for outdoor recreation – such as a coffee on a bench or a picnic in a park - in addition to exercise. But we are advising the Clinically Extremely Vulnerable to shield at least until the end of March. Every care home resident will be able to nominate a named visitor, able to see them regularly provided they are tested and wear PPE. And finally we will amend regulations to enable a broader range of Covid-secure campaign activities for local elections on 6 May. As part of Step one, we will go further and make limited changes on 29 March, when schools go on Easter holidays. It will become possible to meet in limited numbers outdoors, where the risk is lower. So the Rule of Six will return outdoors, including in private gardens and outdoor meetings of two households will also be permitted on the same basis, so that families in different circumstances can meet. Outdoor sports facilities – such as tennis and basketball courts, and open-air swimming pools – will be able to reopen and formally organised outdoor sports will resume, subject to guidance. From this point, 29 March, people will no longer be legally required to stay at home but many lockdown restrictions will remain. People should continue to work from home where they can and minimise all travel wherever possible. Step two will begin at least five weeks after the beginning of step one and no earlier than 12 April, with an announcement at least seven days in advance. If analysis of the latest data against the four tests requires a delay, then this and subsequent steps will also be delayed to maintain the five week gap. In step two non-essential retail will reopen, as will personal care including hairdressers I’m glad to say, and nail salons. Indoor leisure facilities such as gyms will re-open, as will holiday-lets, but only for use by individuals or household groups. We will begin to re-open our pubs and restaurants outdoors and Hon Members will be relieved there will be no curfew and the Scotch Egg debate will be over because there will be no requirement for alcohol to be accompanied by a substantial meal. Zoos, theme parks and drive-in cinemas will re-open as will public libraries and community centres. Step three will begin no earlier than 17 May. Provided the data satisfies the four tests, most restrictions on meetings outdoors will be lifted, subject to a limit of thirty. And this is the point when you will be able to see your friends and family indoors - subject to the Rule of Six or the meeting of two households. We will also reopen pubs and restaurants indoors along with cinemas and children’s play areas, hotels, hostels, and B&Bs. Theatres and concert halls will open their doors, and the turnstiles of our sports stadia will once again rotate subject in all cases to capacity limits depending on the size of the venue. And we will pilot larger events using enhanced testing, with the ambition of further easing of restrictions in the next step. Step 4 will begin no earlier than 21 June. With appropriate mitigations, we will aim to remove all legal limits on social contact, and on weddings and other life events. We will re-open everything up to and including nightclubs, and enable large events such as theatre performances above the limits of step 3, potentially using testing to reduce the risk of infection. Mr Speaker, our journey back towards normality will be subject to resolving a number of key questions and to do this we will conduct four reviews. One will assess how long we need to maintain social distancing and face masks. This will also inform guidance on working from home – which should continue wherever possible until this review is complete. And it will be critical in determining how Parliament can safely return in a way that I know Hon Members would wish. A second review will consider the resumption of international travel which is vital for many businesses which have been hardest hit including retail, hospitality, tourism and aviation. A successor to the Global Travel Taskforce will report by 12 April so that people can plan for the summer. The third review will consider the potential role of Covid-status certification in helping venues to open safely but mindful of the many concerns surrounding exclusion, discrimination and privacy. And the fourth review will look at the safe return of major events. Mr Speaker, as we proceed through these steps we will benefit from the combined protection of our vaccines and the continued expansion of rapid testing. We will extend the provision of free test kits for workplaces until the end of June and families, small businesses and the self-employed can collect those tests from local testing sites. Mr Speaker, in view of these cautious but I hope irreversible changes, people may be concerned about what these changes mean for the various support packages, for livelihoods for people and for the economy. So I want to assure the House, we will not pull the rug out. For the duration of the pandemic, the government will continue to do whatever it takes to protect jobs and livelihoods across the UK. And my Rt Hon Friend the Chancellor will set out further details in the Budget next Wednesday, Finally, Mr Speaker, we must remain alert to the constant mutations of the virus. Next month we will publish an updated plan for responding to local outbreaks, with a range of measures to address variants of concern, including surge PCR testing and enhanced contact tracing. We can’t, I’m afraid, rule out re-imposing restrictions at local or regional level if evidence suggests they are necessary to contain or suppress a new variant which escapes the vaccines. Mr Speaker, I know there will be many people who will be worried that we are being too ambitious and that it is arrogant to impose any kind of plan upon a virus. And I agree that we must always be humble in the face of nature and we must be cautious but I really also believe that the vaccination programme has dramatically changed the odds in our favour and it is on that basis that we can now proceed. And of course there will be others who will believe that we could go faster on the basis of that vaccination programme and I understand their feelings and I sympathise very much with the exhaustion and the stress that people are experiencing and that businesses are experiencing after so long in lockdown. But to them I say that today the end really is in sight and a wretched year will give way to a spring and a summer that will be very different and incomparably better than the picture we see around us today. And in that spirit, I commend this Statement to the House"
"Boris Johnson","PM statement at coronavirus press conference: 22 February 2021","22 February 2021","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-statement-at-coronavirus-press-conference-22-february-2021","Good evening, Our extraordinary NHS has now succeeded in vaccinating more than 17.7 million people across the United Kingdom and nearly a year after the pandemic began This unparalleled national effort has decisively shifted the odds in our favour so that we no longer have to rely simply on lockdowns and restricting our behaviour and putting our lives on hold But with every day that goes by this programme of vaccination is creating a shield around the entire population which means that we are now travelling on a one way road to freedom. And we can begin safely to restart our lives and do it with confidence. But I want to be frank about exactly what that means and the trade-offs involved. The vaccines reduce the danger of Covid: they save lives and they keep people out of hospital. But no vaccine against any disease has ever been 100 per cent effective. So whenever we ease the lockdown, whether it is today or in six or nine months, We’ve got to be realistic and accept that there will be more infections, more hospitalisations and therefore – sadly - more deaths, just as there are every year with flu. Even if we sustained the lockdown indefinitely, which would itself cost lives and do immeasurable harm to our children, we would not be able to eradicate this disease. And that’s why it’s right gradually to replace the protection afforded by the lockdown with the protection of the vaccines, and our approach is to move with the utmost care, and advancing in four steps, each with a minimum of five weeks apart so we can fully judge the impact of each relaxation before we move on, and you can see the details of all of this on gov.uk. And we will be led at every stage by data not dates, and we will apply four tests: the pace of the vaccination programme; the effectiveness of the vaccines; the pressure on the NHS; and the risks of any new variants of Covid. And therefore as we look at the data today, I can confirm that two weeks from today – Monday 8th March – we will begin step one and schools and colleges across England will re-open and teaching in classrooms can start again. All the evidence shows that schools are safe and the risk posed to children by Covid is vanishingly small. But to offer even greater reassurance, we are introducing twice-weekly testing of secondary school and college pupils and asking them to wear face coverings for the rest of this term. Students on practical courses can return to university, but all others will need to continue learning online and we will review the situation before the end of the Easter holidays. We will allow breakfast and afterschool clubs to restart and among other changes on 8 March, you’ll be able to have a coffee on a bench or a picnic in a park with one person outside your household. And because we know how stressful this time has been and how people yearn to see friends and family if only fleetingly we will now go further and on 29 March, you can meet more of your friends and family outside, including in gardens – either as two households or subject to the Rule of Six. And then we will go to step two – which is no earlier than 12 April – when shops will return and re-open, hairdressers, nail salons will reopen pubs and restaurants will all be able to serve customers outside – precisely because we know the risk of outside transmission is lower. And then five weeks after that, no earlier than 17 May, we will go to step three and open all our hospitality sector to service indoors pubs, bars, restaurants, along with hotels and cinemas, and, subject to capacity limits, we will also open sports stadia, concert halls and theatres. And finally - provided we continue to pass the four tests - then from 21 June we will go to step four and say goodbye to most remaining restrictions: resuming large-scale events like business conferences and football matches, lifting the limits on weddings and reopening nightclubs. All of these steps will apply in England, and the government will continue to do whatever it takes to protect jobs and livelihoods across our whole United Kingdom for the duration of the pandemic. I know there are some who would like to accelerate this timetable and I know of course there are others who would like to be more cautious and stay in the slow lane. I understand and sympathise with both of those points of view because levels of infection are still high and we must strike a very careful balance and always accept we must be humble in the face of nature. But also, we must accept that we cannot persist indefinitely with restrictions that have separated families and loved ones for too long, and threatened the livelihoods of millions, and kept pupils out of school. It is thanks to the roll-out of the vaccinations, some of them pioneered in this country that the balance of that judgement is now changing in our favour. And it is thanks to the vaccinations that there is light ahead leading us to a spring and summer which I think will be seasons of hope, looking and feeling incomparably better for us all and from which we will not go back."
"Boris Johnson","PM Boris Johnson's address to the UN Security Council on Climate and Security: 23 February 2021","23 February 2021","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-boris-johnsons-address-to-the-un-security-council-on-climate-and-security-23-february-2021","For more than 75 years, this Security Council has been tasked with maintaining peace and security and it’s been difficult. We haven’t always agreed about how to achieve that goal. But one thing is absolutely clear to me: that we are committed to tackling threats to our security, and as you’ve heard from Antonio, and from Nisreen it is absolutely clear that climate change is a threat to our collective security and the security of our nations. And I know there are people around the world who will say this is all kind of “green stuff” from a bunch of tree-hugging tofu munchers and not suited to international diplomacy and international politics. I couldn’t disagree more profoundly. The causes of climate change we’ve got to address, but the effects as you’ve heard from Nisreen, and as you’ve heard from Antonio, in those speeches just now, are absolutely clear. Think of the young man forced onto the road when his home becomes a desert, one of 16 million people displaced every year as a result of weather-related disasters - weather-related disasters that are associated with climate change. He goes to some camp, he becomes prey for violent extremists, people who radicalise him and the effects of that radicalisation are felt around the world. “Think of the girl who drops out of school because her daily search for water takes her further and further from her family – and into the clutches of human traffickers and the international criminal gangs who profit from them. Or think of a farmer who has lost harvest after harvest to drought and then switches to poppies because poppies are a hardier crop, with the impacts that the opium crops have on the streets of all our cities, quite frankly. Or think of the impoverished and fragile nation whose government collapses when critical infrastructure is overwhelmed by increasingly frequent extreme weather - of a kind that sends shockwaves of instability around the world. Now if that kind of result, in terms of political, economic, humanitarian impact, if that was being triggered by some kind of despotic warlord or civil war, then nobody would question the right and the duty of this UN Security Council to act, and therefore this is not a subject we can shy away from. This isn’t by the way, like so many of the issues that I know you confront, Antonio, this isn’t some bafflingly complex diplomatic minuet, this isn’t some modern equivalent of the Schleswig-Holstein question – can you remember the answer to the Schleswig-Holstein question, Antonio? I bet you can. People know the answer to climate change and they know how to tackle this crisis. And as Bill Gates put it in his new book, what we’ve got to do is go from 51 billion tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions each year to net zero, so the increase in global temperatures remains at manageable levels. And as we do so we must support the most vulnerable and fragile nations that are feeling the effects of climate change, help them to adapt and to build resilience. And that’s what we’re doing. So last year [sic: 2019] we passed a law committing us, the UK, to achieving net zero carbon-emissions by 2050. And we’ve pledged to slash emissions by 68 per cent by 2030, that’s the steepest reduction for any major economy. Our climate finance commitments for the next five years, supporting the rest of the world to achieve this, stand at £11.6 billion. And, ahead of the COP26 summit we’re going to be putting climate change firmly at the top of the agenda for our G7 presidency as well. So my message to you all today is now the UN Security Council has got to act too. Because climate change is a geopolitical issue every bit as much as it is an environmental one. And if this Council is going to succeed in maintaining peace and security worldwide then it’s got to galvanise the whole range of UN agencies and organisations into a swift and effective response. “If we don’t act now, when will we act? That’s my question. When are we going to do something if we don’t act now? When changing sea levels are affecting our navigation around our coasts? Or when, as Nisreen said, when huddled masses fleeing drought or wildfire, or conflict over resources arrive at our borders? Whether you like it or not, it is a matter of when, not if, your country and your people will have to deal with the security impacts of climate change. So let’s do what this Council was created to do and let’s show the kind of global leadership that is needed to protect the peace, the security and the stability of our nations, of our regions and of our world. Thank you all very much. Sir David Attenborough also addressed the Council via pre-recorded video. His remarks are below. Sir David Attenborough on Climate and Security - Security Council Open VTC Thank you Prime Minister and members of the Security Council. I am greatly honoured to have this opportunity to speak to you. I am not a politician, nor am I a diplomat. I speak as a member of the public who listens to your deliberations and pronouncements with care and concern. We know that the security of the entire world depends on your decisions. That you hold the key to preventing a repetition of that global catastrophe, the Great War, that took place during my youth and transformed a whole generation. And that awesome responsibility, I know well, still rests with you. But may I plead that today there are threats to security of a new and unprecedented kind. These threats do not divide us. They are threats which should unite us, no matter from which part of the world we come, for they face us all. They are: rising global temperatures; the despoiling of the ocean, that vast universal larder on which people everywhere depend for their food; changes in the pattern of weather worldwide that pay no regard to national boundaries, but that can turn forests into deserts, drown great cities and lead to the extermination of huge numbers of the other creatures with which we share this planet. No matter what we do now, some of these threats will assuredly become reality within a few short years. Others could, in the lifetime of today’s young people, destroy entire cities and societies, even altering the stability of the entire world. The heating of our planet has already reached the point that the impacts on the poorest and most vulnerable people are profound. But this is only the beginning of this crisis. In the last 150 years, the world has warmed on average by just over 1 degree Celsius and our atmosphere now contains concentrations of carbon dioxide that have not been equalled for millions of years. We are today perilously close to tipping points that, once passed, will send global temperatures spiralling catastrophically higher. If we continue on our current path, we will face the collapse of everything that gives us our security: food production, access to fresh water, habitable ambient temperature and ocean food chains. And if the natural world can no longer support the most basic of our needs, then much of the rest of civilisation will quickly break down. Please, make no mistake, climate change is the biggest threat to security that modern humans have ever faced. I don’t envy you the responsibility that this places on all of you and your governments. We have left the stable and secure climatic period that gave birth to our civilisation. There is no going back. No matter what we do now, it’s too late to avoid climate change. And the poorest and most vulnerable – those with the least security – are now certain to suffer. Our duty right now is surely to do all we can to help those in the most immediate danger. But of course we have a parallel duty, and it’s here where I think there are grounds for hope. While it’s true we can never go back to the stable benign climate that enabled us to flourish for the past 10,000 years, I do believe that if we act fast enough, we can reach a new stable state. In November this year, at COP26 in Glasgow, we have what may be our last opportunity to make this step change. If we recognise climate change and the loss of nature as worldwide security threats, as indeed they are, then we may yet act proportionately and in time. The change needed in itself sounds immense, and of course it is, but we already have many of the technologies needed, at least for the initial changes. And perhaps crucially, we also have a level of public support and demand for action that I have myself never seen before. People today all over the world now realise this is no longer an issue which will affect future generations. It is people alive today, and in particular young people, who will live with the consequences of our actions. Politicians and business leaders know this too, having seen how quickly and radically their societies and global activities were affected by Covid, it is now sadly easier to imagine some of the consequences of climate change. Perhaps the most significant lesson brought by these last 12 months has been that we are no longer separate nations, each best served by looking after its own needs and security. We are a single truly global species whose greatest threats are shared and whose security must ultimately come from acting together in the interests of us all. Climate change is a threat to global security that can only be dealt with by unparalleled levels of global co-operation. It will compel us to: question our economic models and where we place value; invent entirely new industries; recognise the moral responsibility that wealthy nations have to the rest of the world; and put a value on nature that goes far beyond money. And through global co-operation, we may achieve far more than tackling climate change. We may finally create a stable, healthy world where resources are equally shared and where we thrive in balance with the rest of the natural world. We may, for the first time in the entire history of humanity, come to know what it feels like to be secure."
"Boris Johnson","Robert Jenrick's speech to the Centre for Social Justice","25 February 2021","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/robert-jenricks-speech-to-the-centre-for-social-justice","Thank you for that kind introduction. It’s a pleasure to join you and the Centre for Social Justice at the launch of your ‘Close to Home’ report which makes a really powerful contribution to the debate around how we can end rough sleeping. In particular, I want to thank Andy Cook and Joe Shalam who are tireless campaigners; the work that the CSJ publishes is both inspirational and integral to our plans for the future. What guides you is what guides this government: a belief that opportunities should be more equal and background no barrier to success. And a commitment to helping those who have been held back by accident, circumstance or misstep, to achieve the fulfilment and happiness of rewarding work, security at home and nourishing relationships. The pandemic has reminded us as Robert Kennedy said, that those who live with us are our brothers and sisters, that they share with us the same short moment of life, that they seek, as we do, nothing but the chance to live out their lives in purpose and in happiness. Which is why our goal to reduce rough sleeping is more important than ever. An extraordinary thing has happened over the course of the past year: the pandemic has accelerated and magnified many forces like never before, upending people’s lives, businesses and communities. But it is rare that something entirely positive has happened, and that is the manner in which we as a country have supported rough sleepers throughout the pandemic. Our priority is to ensure that the 37,000 vulnerable people and rough sleepers ‘Everyone In’ has helped never return to a life on the streets. We have made good progress so far with at least 26,000 of those supported by the programme now in long term accommodation, and new figures published today paint a picture of a country that is changing. I am pleased to tell you that the number of people sleeping rough has fallen for the third year in a row. Across England, the numbers have fallen by 37% to 2,688. And since Boris Johnson became Prime Minister, the number of people rough sleeping has reduced by over 40%. We have also published, alongside the snapshot this year, additional management information indicating that the number of people on the streets reported by local authorities fell to 1,743 in December and 1,461 in January. For the first time in many years London has seen a significant fall as well, mirroring the rest of the country with a 37% decrease. And again, that achievement has been built upon in the months that have passed since. I want to say thank you to the hard work of Rachael Robathan and Georgia Gould – the leaders of Westminster and Camden councils and their respective teams in the West End. The London figures published today, which show the largest decrease since these statistics began, highlight the impact of their work and the dedication of the staff. We’ve seen a number of areas that have reached 0 rough sleepers at the snapshot – including Ashford and Basingstoke – among many others. And major cities have seen quite exceptional improvement, like Birmingham where numbers have fallen to just 17 people. Having, I hope, praised the many great achievements, in all types of places and by councils of all political colours, it is worth noting that there are wide variations, which shows that whilst some local authorities have achieved truly exceptional things this year, there are others somewhat less so. There are differences of approach and of commitment. Those yet to conquer this issue must learn from those that have or are on the way. It is almost a year since I phoned Dame Louise Casey and discussed how the pandemic would impact rough sleepers. Not then a reality in this country, a distant threat, but one whose drumbeat was drawing inexorably closer and louder. Louise was in Australia, struggling to get a flight home. We agreed immediately that the right approach was to emphasise protecting the most vulnerable people among us. And upon her return she came to Marsham Street and in her characteristic way, gave herself fully to the task ahead. I’m immensely grateful to Louise for her energy, commitment and friendship. That conversation, and the meetings that took place in the following weeks led to the birth of the Everyone In programme, and later the next phase, our Protect Programme. A programme that has saved many lives. TS Eliot said that sometimes things become possible if we want them badly enough. That describes Everyone In. But you also need exceptional people. The work of staff in shelters, of council support workers, of outreach workers, of volunteers at soup kitchens and to so many others – whose work is unglamorous and often unnoticed, but is vital and noble. I should also like to place on record my gratitude for the commitment and dedication of the civil servants at the Ministry of Housing with whom I work. Under the superb leadership of Penny Hobman and Catherine Bennion, who demonstrate every day a real passion and idealism for this cause. We know that the community, charity and faith sectors are instrumental to this effort. Importantly, nobody comes off the streets because of the work of one agency. A critical element of the success of Everyone In was due to the quality of our partnerships: so I must extend thanks and gratitude to those charities that have paved the way on this issue, especially to the inspirational Jon Sparkes from Crisis and Petra Salva from St Mungo’s. And I need to thank my two immediate predecessors in this role, Sajid Javid and James Brokenshire. It would be wrong to see Everyone In as some kind of remarkable start-up. Its success was built on the foundations they had laid. Both cared passionately about this issue, and indeed do still. Sajid started the Housing First pilot – work that as we will hear today, the CSJ has proved so vital in spearheading. The Homelessness Reduction Act happened under his leadership. James oversaw the reinvigoration of the Rough Sleepers Initiative, whose impact is well evidenced and had driven the two prior years of reductions, in 2018 and 2019. As our vaccination programme gathers speed and we begin to turn the tide on COVID-19, it is right that we cement the incredible gains we have made over the last twelve months, acknowledging the seriousness and the weight of the challenges we have yet to face. The late Lord Ashdown, in a notable speech on homelessness, once compared tackling rough sleeping at times of economic disruption to “leaves in a gale” – the faster you collect the leaves, the faster they gust away again, and all the time more fall around you in the headwind. And there will be headwinds to come as we exit lockdown and move beyond the pandemic. The truth is, we cannot begin to tackle this issue until we begin to tackle its causes: which are multi-faceted and complex. Unemployment, family breakdown, domestic abuse, insecure housing, criminal justice policy, failures in our immigration system, and above all else – substance misuse and mental health. So we’re utilising the expertise of all government departments from the Ministry of Justice and the Home Office to the Departments of Health and of Work and Pensions, investing over £750 million next year to continue to reduce homelessness and rough sleeping and invest in preventative programmes which tackle the underlying issues early. It is vital that we bring together health and housing to tackle rough sleeping. The marriage of health and housing will be the heart of our strategy. That is why we have brought forward an investment of £150 million in long-term housing through our Rough Sleeping Accommodation Programme, delivering 3,000 new homes. And a further £272 million will be invested over the course of this Parliament providing 6,000 vital new homes for rough sleepers - the largest ever investment of this kind. These will be a national asset – symbols of hope and opportunity for those looking to turn their lives around. Thanks to the hard work and perseverance of Robert Buckland and Lucy Frazer at the Ministry of Justice, we are tackling reoffending, ensuring more prison leavers are offered accommodation at release and building a criminal justice system based on second chances and redemption. That takes inspiration from, amongst others, the direction set by Michael Gove when he was Justice Secretary – and I his bag-carrying PPS. It has always stayed with me that more than 50% of rough sleepers have spent time in prison. This must be at the front of our minds as we frame our strategy. At the Home Office, Priti Patel shares my commitment to supporting victims of domestic abuse and together we have seen the Domestic Abuse Act implemented and fully funded with £120 million of financial support for local councils next year. And together we will use the new freedoms we have as a sovereign country, to create a better and fairer immigration system, so that fewer foreign nationals end up on our streets and those that do can be compassionately and considerately returned to their home countries. On health and housing, almost two thirds of homeless people cite addiction to drugs and alcohol as both a cause and consequence of rough sleeping. We know the toll that substance misuse takes on individuals and on families – and drug addiction is a global human crisis, at the very heart of this issue, more important than ever as we come out of the pandemic; which emerging evidence suggests has amplified substance misuse through unemployment, isolation and anxiety. The homeless will not be forgotten when it comes to the vaccination. Last night we asked all local authorities to redouble their efforts to safely accommodate as many rough sleepers as they can and to register them with a GP, as a good in itself, but also as a precursor to vaccination. At this crucial stage in our vaccination programme, there really is no time to waste. So we have also allocated a further £10 million of funding to help protect people rough sleeping this winter and ensure their wider health needs are met. We need to follow in the footsteps of my now somewhat distant predecessor Sir George Young who worked hand-in-hand with homelessness charities in pioneering the first Rough Sleeping Initiative. That same sense of urgency and resolve is needed again today. I want to be unequivocal in stating that we will use every mechanism at our disposal to achieve our goal. And yes, Housing First is an integral part of that mission. I’m grateful to Brooks Newmark for his role in establishing Housing First. As a former Treasury Minister under Philip Hammond I can say it was no mean feat of Brooks and Sajid to persuade him to back it. Our £28 million Housing First pilots in Greater Manchester, Liverpool and West Midlands are already supporting around 800 of our most vulnerable people off the streets and into secure homes. 600 are now in permanent accommodation. Over 2,000 other Housing First places have been created, many funded through the Rough Sleeping Initiative and our new accommodation programme draws inspiration from it. I have seen it in action myself. Last Christmas Eve I met a woman in Walsall and Housing First was helping to turn her life around after several years of sleeping rough in local parks and of drug addiction. It was working and she was re-entering society and re-establishing herself as a productive member of it. As I left her flat to drive home to my family, I turned around and watched her welcome her children to her home for the first time in many years. For their first Christmas together in many years. I couldn’t help, but cry. Rough sleeping a terrible waste of lives. To see dignity and purpose and the love of family and friends restored is a wonderful thing to behold. So I will champion Housing First. One solution – it goes without saying – will not fit all. This must be multi-targeted and multi-focus. But the principle that everything begins with a home will be our guiding star. Our strategy will be refined, with the guidance and support of all those willing to offer it to us, but our objective is clear, that no one should have to sleep rough in this country. That is a litmus test of a civilised society. And we will raise the safety net from the street, but addressing the causes as well as the consequences. Not so much no second night out, but no first night out. As we come out of the pandemic, and as the Prime Minister has said, we must aspire to build back better. This means not merely mending, or simply restoring a status quo. Nor even more improvement. It is not like teaching a horse to jump better, but like turning a horse into a winged creature that will soar over fences which could never have been jumped, said CS Lewis. It is in that spirit we will work, together, to resign rough sleeping to the history books once and for all."
"Boris Johnson","The Green Industrial Revolution needs Green Industrial Regulation","3 March 2021","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/the-green-industrial-revolution-needs-green-industrial-regulation","In July, US President Joe Biden said: “When I hear the words climate change, I hear the word “jobs”. In September, President Xi Jinping pledged China would achieve carbon neutrality before 2060. In November, the UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson published a ten point plan for a Green Industrial Revolution, mobilising £12 billion of investment and supporting up to 250,000 British jobs to achieve net zero. We are in a race. Nations that help businesses decarbonise and prepare infrastructure for climate impacts fastest win investment. Industries the Environment Agency regulates tell us a strong framework of green legislation gives them an economic advantage over global competitors. Operating within England’s environmental regulations should be an assurance that a business is working to some of the highest standards on the planet. This has a global snowball effect, if businesses prove profitable environmental improvements in one jurisdiction, they can demonstrate an operating model that can be scaled-up elsewhere. Setting an example is important. At the Environment Agency, we are using our activities and supply chain as a laboratory to find new ways to reach net zero, such as low carbon concrete for flood defences. We have achieved a 47 percent reduction in our own direct emissions in the last 14 years, and are pushing ahead with our own 2030 net zero goal. We will reduce our emissions by a further 45 percent by 2030, and address the effect of our remaining emissions through offsetting. As our regulation helps business reach net zero, we will use our operations and supply contracts to help companies innovate and set an example. In the 2 years between January 2017 and December 2018, the Climate Change Agreements the Environment Agency administers saved about 45,653 gigawatt hours of power, equivalent to 9 million tonnes of carbon dioxide, or enough energy to supply over 2 million homes a year. Since 2010 emissions of greenhouse gases from the sites we regulate under the Environmental Permitting Regulations have decreased by 43 percent. The Environment Agency has now begun to operate the new UK Emissions Trading Scheme. We have worked with BEIS and the Devolved Administrations to shape the new regime, and there is an opportunity to go further. Significant carbon reduction has happened in the UK with the switch to renewable energies. For instance, the UK has the largest installed capacity of offshore wind in the world, with around 10 gigawatts in operation off its coasts. The Environment Agency is ready to regulate new nuclear power, including the possibility of Small Modular Reactors. We’re also developing our regulatory role and guidance to meet the new demand in hydrogen, with an ambition to replace natural gas in domestic supply. And, we are preparing for a range of greenhouse gas removal technologies such as carbon capture and storage, which - when combined with biomass - has the potential for much-needed negative emissions. Enabling such new technologies will help the Government’s levelling-up agenda, as the focus will be on regeneration, and resilience, in industrial clusters up and down the country. Good regulation provides proof. For investors to measure the success of projects by their green credentials, they want metrics of the sort provided by environmental regulators. In markets flooded with greenwash, people want science-based unbiased monitoring of companies’ performance. The 10 point plan for a Green Industrial Revolution calls for over £30 billion of private capital to support the Government’s investment by creating investable markets. Regulation underpins carbon markets by providing accurate and transparent monitoring and reporting which provides assurance that a tonne of greenhouse gas is demonstrably a tonne of greenhouse gas, wherever it is emitted or removed from the atmosphere. In 2019 we delivered over 98 percent compliance in the 5 major energy efficiency and emissions trading schemes we administer. They cover over 40 percent of the UK’s carbon emission from industry, business and the public sector. Equally, well performing water companies celebrate success in the Environment Agency’s Environmental Performance Assessment of the water and sewerage companies, because they know that investors and customers trust its findings when they see them reported in the media. Good regulation works. Last week, the Environment Agency’s Regulating for People, Environment and Growth 2019 report showed many improving trends in environmental compliance, pollution incidents, crime, and emissions. In 2019, the Environment Agency stopped illegal waste activity at 940 sites, 3 percent more than the previous year. In 2019, the number of serious pollution incidents fell 12 percent from the previous year, and waste recovery or reuse at permitted sites has improved to a record 74 percent. It also showed that emissions of air pollutants have fallen significantly since 2010: nitrogen oxides by 63 percent, PM10 particulates by 34 percent, and sulphur oxides by 81 percent. Acid rain was a major concern 20 years ago but - as a result of environmental regulation, and over a 90 percent reduction in sulphur oxide emissions from regulated industry - it is no longer a feature of life here. Good regulation delivers fairness. Permitting and licensing activities enable businesses to carry out their operations. Robust regulation provides the level playing field legitimate businesses need to prevent being undercut by irresponsible, or illegal operators. A central tenet of environmental regulation is that the polluter should pay. No regulation works unless there is a threat. Farming is an extremely diverse sector in terms of activities and income. For the intensive pig and poultry sector - where the Environment Agency can carry out regular visits because we can charge farmers for permits to operate - there were only 4 category 1 and 2 pollution incidents in 2019. But, pollution problems are rife in the dairy and intensive beef farming sectors. The sectors also contribute around half of the UK agriculture greenhouse gas emissions and ammonia emissions- a key reduction target under the Government’s Clean Air Strategy. These are largely an outcome of the tough economics of the food system, compounded by rising climate impacts. But, they are now being exacerbated because the Environment Agency lacks the resources to tackle such incidents in diary and intensive beef farming where we have almost 3 times more pollution incidents than we can do proactive regulatory visits to prevent them. When polluters don’t think they will be caught, or have to pay, there is no deterrent. At the other end of the economic spectrum there is lack of deterrent for the largest companies in all sectors. Fines for environmental crimes are disproportionately small compared to, for example, breaches in financial services. Fines need to hurt. Even Thames Water’s £20 million fine was only ten days’ worth of operating profit. And, I know of one waste company that threw huge legal resources at challenging a fine that amounted to less than one year of the Chief Executive’s annual cash bonus. That is not what a system that puts the environment at the heart of the economy looks like. Economic turnover penalties are the next natural step if, after fair warning, large companies do not turn around their performance. This means the most serious breaches by very large companies would be based in the future on a percentage of turnover of the company. Below this I would like to see the criminal courts apply penalties consistently and proportionately. Anything less is no deterrent. Dr Rhian-Mari Thomas, Chief Executive of the Green Finance Institute, said in reaction to The Dasgupta Review on the Economics of Biodiversity: “So far, the ‘E’ in ESG [Environmental Social Governance] has primarily been a ‘C’ for climate, but we cannot solve the climate unless we solve for nature. They are two sides of the same coin. We need to look at nature risk in the same way we do for climate – as a systemic risk to the financial system.” At the Environment Agency we’re looking into a range of Nature-Based Solutions as an advisor to industries we regulate. Activities that lock in carbon - like tree planting, restoring peatland, managing soils, wetlands and saltmarsh - offer decarbonising opportunities in addition to creating resilience to flood risk, supporting biodiversity, and providing health and wellbeing benefits to communities. The public health costs of air pollution (not to mention flooding, heatwaves and noise pollution) runs into the billions. Investing in environmental regulation would provide major benefits to the NHS. The Environment Agency’s regulatory work has led to £5 billion of investment from the water companies over five years to improve rivers and groundwater. The Office for National Statistics says freshwaters, which include surface waters and groundwaters, are worth at least £40 billion to the economy. In 2019, 98.3 percent of bathing waters on the coast met or exceeded the minimum standard and more than 70 percent were rated as excellent. Maintaining high quality bathing waters benefits health and wellbeing as well as boosting local economies. There were 135 million day visits taken to the seaside in England in 2019, worth £5.8 billion to the economy. The decision to designate the River Wharfe at Ilkley as a bathing water marks a first for England, and we look forward to the challenge of working with partners to improve the river to bathing waters standard. Today’s report from the Aldersgate Group finds that regulations in the construction, waste and automotive sectors have delivered growing business investment in innovation, new products and services, job creation and skills. It recommends that environmental regulations and standards do not sit in a silo. To be economically and environmentally effective, environmental regulations should be carefully joined up across sectors, and with the UK’s overall industrial strategy. It says they should promote high degrees of resource efficiency and be accompanied by investment in supporting infrastructure (such as charging points for electric vehicles), research and development, skills and market access. I agree. We have everything to gain from realising the strengths of the connections between trade, climate change and nature recovery – in terms of jobs, green goods, services, and technologies. Tomorrow, in the Budget, the Chancellor is expected to confirm £22 billion to fund a national infrastructure bank that will fund £40 billion of infrastructure projects. That infrastructure needs to be resilient to climate shocks. The Chancellor is also expected to confirm the world’s first sovereign green savings bond, which will invest £20 million in offshore wind, £70 million in long-term low-carbon energy storage and £4 million to boost the production of green energy crops. As the economy recovers from the coronavirus pandemic, the investment community cannot ignore the direction of travel. In this year of crunch climate negotiations, when the UK Government hosts the G7 and COP26, the race to zero and the race to resilience have already started. Now, the UK could also fire the starting gun on a global economic race to raise the trillions needed to tackle the climate emergency and restore nature. But, to underpin this vital trajectory in the UK’s fortunes we need strong environmental regulation. Environmental regulators need to keep in lockstep with economic and financial regulators, outpacing climate change and matching the scale of the challenge. Environmental regulation – through its example, enforcement, monitoring and metrics – can support profitable green industry here and demonstrate market effectiveness everywhere, so that no country gets left behind in this century of climate opportunity. But, if the polluter isn’t made to pay, that aspiration will wither on the vine. We will only get the environment the whole country is prepared to pay for. The Green Industrial Revolution needs strong Green Industrial Regulation."
"Boris Johnson","Deteriorating human rights situation in Russia: UK statement","4 March 2021","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/deteriorating-human-rights-situation-in-russia-uk-statement","Madam Chair, The human rights situation in Russia continues to deteriorate and this is of deep concern. I would like to highlight today four cases and areas. Firstly, it is disgraceful that Alexey Navalny, himself the victim of a despicable crime, has been sentenced on arbitrary charges. We have expressed our concern previously here in this forum and also at the Council of Europe, and the UN Human Rights Council, and continue to call for his immediate and unconditional release. Secondly, we also reiterate our previous calls for the release of Mr Yuri Dmitriev. We believe Mr Dmitriev’s case is a politically-motivated prosecution, triggered by his work as a historian and representative of the human rights organisation Memorial. Given Mr Dmitriev’s age, health, and the COVID-19 pandemic, there are also strong humanitarian reasons for his release. Thirdly, we must also highlight - unfortunately not for the first time - the concerning situation of Jehovah’s Witnesses in the Russian Federation. The 2017 ruling of the Russian Supreme Court, which rejected the appeal against the decision to categorise Jehovah’s Witnesses as “extremists”, criminalised the peaceful worship of 175,000 Russian citizens and contravened the right to religious freedom that is enshrined in the Russian Constitution, and in multiple OSCE commitments. Since that 2017 ruling, we have witnessed an increasing number of detentions, criminal investigations and prosecutions of Jehovah’s Witnesses across Russia, including the arrest and sentencing of Valentina Baranovskaya and Roman Baranovskiy on 24 February, and the sentencing of Aleksandr Ivshin on 10 February. Such cases reinforce the impression of an organised campaign of persecution against Jehovah’s Witnesses. And fourthly, 27 February marks the sixth anniversary of the murder of Boris Nemtsov in Moscow, then a leading figure within the Russian opposition. We extend our sincere condolences to Mr Nemtsov’s family and friends, and urge the Russian authorities to bring those responsible to justice, and end the culture of impunity for attacks on political activists, journalists and human rights defenders. We remind Russia that as an OSCE participating State, they have freely signed up to a series of commitments in the OSCE’s human dimension which they must uphold."
"Boris Johnson","PM statement at coronavirus press conference: 8 March 2021","8 March 2021","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-statement-at-coronavirus-press-conference-8-march-2021","Good afternoon this has been a big day and an emotional day for millions of families up and down the country as children see – and play with – their friends for the first time in months. And although I know that some will have been anxious as pupils always are on the first day of term – I also know that the overwhelming feeling is one of relief. And we all know that the education of our children is so important that the greater risk now is keeping them out of school for a day longer. I want to thank all the teachers who have got their schools ready and who have been teaching throughout the whole period – whether that’s remotely or in person - your work has been astonishing. And I want to thank the parents and all those who have been teaching at home who have had to master Zoom who’ve had to communicate every detail of the syllabus from fronted adverbials to quadratic equations. And we all know that the burden has disproportionately fallen on women, often holding down jobs and providing childcare at the same time. So our job now as government is to build on your efforts so that from now on our school children not only catch up on lost learning but take the biggest possible step forwards with a concerted national programme for educational recovery. It is thanks to all of you parents, teachers, pupils – thanks to this huge national effort to keep kids at home that we have been able significantly to reduce the spread of the virus. And so today we have been able to take that crucial first step on what we hope is our cautious but irreversible roadmap to freedom Today allowing people to meet one-on-one outside for the first time in months, allowing care home visits to take place with all appropriate precautions. And this first step on the road map is made possible above all by our NHS which has now vaccinated more than one third of the entire UK population. And we take this first step with confidence because all four of the most vulnerable groups have not only been vaccinated in overwhelming numbers but it is now at least three weeks since they received their first dose and so they will be feeling the full benefits of the vaccine protection. We will continue on this roadmap but we must remember that today’s return to schools will of course have an impact on the spread of the virus and so at all times and as we decide on the next steps when we take them we will be driven by the data, and with the number of patients being admitted to hospital with Covid each day still around eight times higher than the lows of last Summer, it is more vital than ever to follow the rules. Hands, face, space, and please continue to stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives. Thank you very much."
"Boris Johnson","Strengthening the sinews of our transport network will make the road to recovery smoother","10 March 2021","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/strengthening-the-sinews-of-our-transport-network-will-make-the-road-to-recovery-smoother","I know there are plenty of people who think we should be going faster out of lockdown. They look at the success of the UK vaccine rollout. They see the falling numbers of deaths and hospitalisations. They think the Government should hurry up and bring forward the timetable. To all of those who want to speed up I say, I understand your urgency. I share your desire to get back to normal. But we must recognise that the rate of infection is still high – much higher than last summer. We can see the signs of a surge of Covid among some of our European friends, and we remember how we in the UK have tended to follow that upwards curve, if a few weeks later. We know how fast this disease can take off, and that Monday’s successful return to school will inevitably add to the budget of risk. The overwhelming majority of people – and businesses – would prefer us to take steps that are cautious but irreversible, rather than go backwards again. They would rather trade haste for certainty. So we will continue on the roadmap we have set out, step by step, jab by jab, until we can get absolutely everything open, at the earliest by June 21. Businesses know how much time they have to plan, and to get ready, and we in government cannot afford to waste a second of the coming weeks. Now is the time to lay the foundations of a lasting and growing recovery. We will prepare to clear the backlogs – from the NHS to the courts. We are bringing forward an ambitious education recovery programme, with a new focus on tutoring. We are addressing the underlying productivity problems of the economy, some of which have been neglected for decades. We are continuing to deliver broadband, at breakneck speed; we are offering a new Lifetime Skills Guarantee; and we are investing massively in the clean and efficient transport projects that can make such a difference to people’s lives and which are so crucial for creating the high-wage jobs we need. As we look at the transport network, there is a particular weakness that has become steadily more obvious in the last 20 years. We have become far too segmented in our thinking. For far too long, we have tended to carve up the country through a devolve and forget approach. We have devised transport strategies for Scotland, for Wales, for Northern Ireland and Northern England – and yet, incredible as it may seem, we have failed to produce a UK-wide transport strategy. We left it, bizarrely, to the EU, which had a concept called the “Trans-European Transport Network”. The UK paid handsomely for our friends to draw these lines on the map, about 420 million euros per year. We only got about ten per cent back. The result is that the sinews of pan-UK transport have atrophied, with inadequate connections, needless bottlenecks and endless delays on the vital links between one part of the UK and another. So together with Transport Secretary Grant Shapps, I have asked Sir Peter Hendy to address the problem of Union connectivity. He has just produced his interim report, before final conclusions in the summer. He lays out the scale of the challenge. Take the A1 – still a single carriageway most of the way north of Newcastle and on into Scotland, in spite of decades of promises. Look at the delays on the M4 as it goes west into South Wales. [Political content removed]. The North Wales economy has amazing potential in aerospace and other sectors. But too little thought has been given to the links to Merseyside and Manchester, to the North Wales railway or the A55. It’s currently quicker to get a train from Cardiff to Paris than from Cardiff to Edinburgh, and why are we stopping HS2 in England? We don’t need a new line; with some bypasses, better track and signalling, as Sir Peter believes, we could run services from Glasgow to London in about 3 hours, and carry more freight too. It seems wrong that someone flying from Belfast to London and back pays more UK tax than someone flying from Dublin to London and back. Isn’t it time to harvest that Brexit dividend and cut Air Passenger Duty to support connectivity across our Union? We will consult on choices to do that. And there was one project that Sir Peter found to command overwhelming support – the A75 from Cairnryan in Scotland to the English border. It is a crucial route for south-west Scotland, for traffic between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and indeed the whole island of Ireland. This road connects three parts of the UK – Northern Ireland, Scotland and England. But it is a single carriageway. For 95 miles. This a long-term arteriosclerosis caused by our failure to think as one UK. As Sir Peter concludes his report, I hope he can produce the beginnings of a truly pan-UK transport strategy. We in the UK Government look forward to working with our partners and friends in the devolved administrations, to see if we can deliver this plan together – not to supplant their own agendas, but to supplement them for the benefit of all the people of the UK. We want to improve pan-UK transport links so as to reduce traffic and to reduce pollution, in a way that is as clean and green and efficient as possible. It is time to begin to strengthen the very sinews – the musculoskeletal structure – of the United Kingdom, so that we can recover faster and stronger together.

"Boris Johnson","PM Boris Johnson: The Oxford vaccine shows why we and the world need Britain to be global","16 March 2021","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-boris-johnson-the-oxford-vaccine-shows-why-we-and-the-world-need-britain-to-be-global","It was in September last year that I felt the first stirrings of optimism about the coronavirus vaccine. I was at the Edward Jenner institute in Oxford, standing behind a scientist as she looked at some magnified blood samples. There were two sets of slides — one from subjects who had been given the vaccine prototype, and one from a control group. The slides from the control group were more or less blank, whereas the slides from the vaccinated group were full of dots — lots of dots. The dots were antibodies. I could tell from the excitement of the scientists that this was promising and that the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine looked as though it would work. After exhaustive tests, so it has proved. That vaccine is safe and works extremely well, and now, only six months later, it is being made in multiple places from India to the US, as well as Britain, and it is being used around the world. It is relatively easy to distribute, since it can be kept in an ordinary fridge, and under the terms of the deal struck between Oxford and the UK government it is being dispensed at cost. You may wonder why we have done it that way, or why the taxpayer has already spent hundreds of millions of pounds, through Covax and other schemes, to put jabs in the arms of other populations. The answer is blindingly obvious — the principle of enlightened self-interest that underlies the integrated review of UK security, defence, development and foreign policy that is published today. Successful as the UK vaccination programme may be, there is little point in achieving some isolated national immunity. We need the whole world to be protected. We need the whole world to have the confidence to open up for trade and travel and holidays and business, all the things that drive jobs and improve our lives at home. The objective of Global Britain is not to swagger or strike attitudes on the world stage. It is to use the full spectrum of our abilities, now amplified by record spending on both defence and science, to engage with and help the rest of the world. That is how we serve the British interest, and I mean the economic interest of people up and down the country. And as the vaccine programme begins to inspire a new global hope, we want to use this moment to heal, both literally and figuratively. The UK is using its G7 presidency to foster ideas for a new world treaty on pandemic preparedness so that next time humanity avoids the sauve qui peut squabbling that has disfigured the last 12 months. There is work to be done on the sharing of data, on the tracking of zoonotic diseases, on quarantine protocols and how to marshal drugs and personal protective equipment. It is obvious from our experience that this would be good for Britain as much as the rest of the world. As we prepare to build back better, we are working with the World Trade Organisation and its new director-general, Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, not only to revive world trade but to address the stagnation that pre-dated the pandemic. At the Cop26 summit in Glasgow the UK is leading the world in the campaign to reduce CO2 emissions and arrest the overheating of the planet. Britain was the first major western country to commit to the goal of net zero by 2050 and it is wonderful — and moving — to see how other countries are now pledging themselves to the same goal. Those pledges will be hollow, however, without serious commitments, mainly to the use of new technology, that will make those reductions happen. Again, we in the UK are taking those big and bold steps, not only because it is good for the world but because these green technologies, from wind to hydrogen to carbon capture, have the potential to create hundreds of thousands of high-wage, high-skill jobs in Britain. It is thanks to our history and geography that the UK is already in many ways more global than our comparators. We have a vast diaspora of people, perhaps five or six million, living abroad, far more as a proportion than most others in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. We may have only 1 per cent of the world’s population, but we are the fifth biggest exporter of goods and services. And we have a third invisible diaspora, far more important and more fruitful even than people or goods, and that is the vast dispersal of British ideas, and British values, puffed around the world like the seeds of some giant pollinating tree. I mean everything from habeas corpus and parliamentary democracy to freedom of speech and gender equality. Sometimes these ideas have flourished, and put forth great roots and branches. Sometimes, frankly, they still fall on stony ground. So under this integrated review we will work ever harder, and give ourselves all the tools we need, to co-ordinate with like-minded democracies in the US, in Europe and around the world to protect and advance those ideas and beliefs against those who oppose them. These values are not uncontested. They are far from universal. That is why the world needs Global Britain more than ever and, to be truly prosperous and successful, Britain needs to be global.

"Boris Johnson","PM statement to the House of Commons on the Integrated Review: 16 March 2021","16 March 2021","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-statement-to-the-house-of-commons-on-the-integrated-review-16-march-2021","Mr Speaker, with permission I will make a statement on the government’s Integrated Review of security, defence, development and foreign policy, which we are publishing today. The overriding purpose of this Review - the most comprehensive since the Cold War – is to make the United Kingdom stronger, safer and more prosperous while standing up for our values. Our international policy is a vital instrument for fulfilling this government’s vision of uniting and levelling up across our country, reinforcing the Union, and securing Britain’s place as a science superpower and a hub of innovation and research. The Review describes how we will bolster our alliances, strengthen our capabilities, find new ways of reaching solutions and relearn the art of competing against states with opposing values. We will be more dynamic abroad and more focused on delivering for our citizens at home. I begin with the essential fact that the fortunes of the British people are almost uniquely interlinked with events on the far side of the world. With limited natural resources we have always earned our living as a maritime trading nation. In 2019 the UK sold goods and services overseas worth £690 billion fully a third of our GDP, sustaining millions of jobs and livelihoods everywhere from Stranraer to St Ives - and making our country the fifth biggest exporter in the world. Between 5 and 6 million Britons – nearly one in ten of us - live permanently overseas, including 175,000 in the Gulf and nearly two million in Asia and Australasia. So a crisis in any of those regions, or in the trade routes connecting them, would be a crisis for us from the very beginning. The truth is that even if we wished it – and of course we don’t– the UK could never turn inwards or be content with the cramped horizons of a regional foreign policy. For us, there are no faraway countries of which we know little. Global Britain is not a reflection of old obligations, still less a vainglorious gesture, but a necessity for the safety and prosperity of the British people in the decades ahead. I am determined that the UK will join our friends to ensure that free societies flourish after the pandemic, sharing the risks and burdens of addressing the world’s toughest problems. The UK’s presidency of the G7 has already produced agreement to explore a global Treaty on Pandemic Preparedness, working through the World Health Organisation to enshrine the steps that countries will need to take to prevent another COVID. We will host COP-26 in Glasgow in November and rally as many nations as possible behind the target of Net Zero by 2050, leading by example since the UK was the first major economy to accept this obligation in law. Britain will remain unswervingly committed to NATO and preserving peace and security in Europe, and from this secure basis, we will seek out friends and partners wherever they can be found, building a coalition for openness and innovation, and engaging more deeply in the Indo-Pacific. I have invited the leaders of Australia, South Korea and India to attend the G7 summit in Carbis Bay in June, and I am delighted to announce that I will visit India next month to strengthen our friendship with the world’s biggest democracy. Our approach will place diplomacy first and the UK has applied to become a dialogue partner of the Association of South East Asian Nations and we will seek to join the Trans-Pacific free trade agreement. But all our international goals rest upon keeping our people safe at home and deterring those who would do us harm. So we will create a Counter-Terrorism Operations Centre, bringing together our ability to thwart the designs of terrorists, while also dealing with the actions of hostile states. It is almost exactly three years since the Russian state used a chemical weapon in Salisbury, killing an innocent mother, Dawn Sturgess, and bringing fear to a tranquil city. I can announce that the National Cyber Force, which conducts offensive cyber operations against terrorists, hostile states and criminal gangs, will in future be located in a cyber corridor in the North West of England. And we will also establish a cross-government Situation Centre in the Cabinet Office, learning the lessons of the pandemic and improving our use of data to anticipate and respond to future crises. The first outcome of the Integrated Review was the government’s decision to invest an extra £24 billion in defence, allowing the wholesale modernisation of our armed forces and taking forward the renewal of our nuclear deterrent. The new money will be focused on mastering the emerging technologies that are transforming warfare, reflecting the premium placed on speed and deployment and technical skill, and my Right Honourable Friend the Defence Secretary will set out the details next week. Later this year, HMS Queen Elizabeth will embark on her maiden deployment, leading a carrier strike group on a 20,000-mile voyage to the Indo-Pacific and back, exercising with Britain’s allies and partners along the way, and demonstrating the importance that we attach to freedom of the seas. By strengthening our armed forces, we will extend British influence while simultaneously creating jobs across the United Kingdom, reinforcing the Union, and maximising our advantage in science and technology. This government will invest more in research and development than any of our predecessors because innovation is the key to our success at home and abroad, from speeding our economic recovery, to shaping emerging technologies in accordance with freedom and openness. We will better protect ourselves against threats to our economic security. Our newly independent trade policy will be an instrument for ensuring that the rules and standards in future trade agreements reflect our values. Our newly independent sanctions policy already allows the UK to act swiftly and robustly wherever necessary and we were the first European country to sanction the generals in Myanmar after the coup last month. In all our endeavours, the United States will be our greatest ally and a uniquely close partner in defence, intelligence and security. Britain’s commitment to the security of our European home will remain unconditional and immoveable, incarnated by our leadership of NATO’s deployment in Estonia. We shall stand up for our values as well as for our interests - and here I commend the vigilance and dedication of Hon Members from all parties. The UK, with the wholehearted support of this whole House, has led the international community in expressing our deep concern over China’s mass detention of the Uighur people in Xinjiang province, and in giving nearly three million of Hong Kong’s people a route to British citizenship. There is no question that China will pose a great challenge for an open society such as ours. But we will also work with China where that is consistent with our values and interests, including building a stronger and positive economic relationship and in addressing climate change. The greater our unity at home, the stronger our influence abroad, which will, in turn, open up new markets and create jobs in every corner of the UK, not only maximising opportunities for the British people but also, I hope, inspiring a sense of pride that their country is willing to follow in its finest traditions and stand up for what is right. With the extra investment and new capabilities of the Integrated Review, I believe the United Kingdom can thrive in an ever more competitive world, and fulfil our historic mission as a force for good, and I commend this statement to the House."
"Boris Johnson","A force for good: Global Britain in a competitive age","17 March 2021","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/a-force-for-good-in-a-competitive-age-foreign-secretary-speech-at-the-aspen-security-conference","Watch the Foreign Secretary’s speech: Foreign Secretary’s speech: a force for good, Britain in a competitive age Yesterday the British Prime Minister Boris Johnson published the Integrated Foreign Policy Review, Global Britain in a Competitive Age. For us it sets out the UK’s international strategy for this decade and beyond. It follows a clear-eyed analysis of our capabilities, and the opportunities and the threats that we face in the world today and tomorrow. Our conclusion – and my argument today – is this. The UK has a central role to play on the world stage as an independent sovereign state, a leading member of the western alliance, and an energetic and dependable partner in the growing prosperity of the Indo-Pacific region. These features of our foreign policy – our independence, our partnerships, our commitment to the East, are all part of the common mission that is Global Britain in the 2020s. That mission is to be a force for good in the world. Force – because let’s not be naïve about it, without power, economic, military, diplomatic, cultural clout, we can’t do anything. But a force for good – because the purpose of this power is to increase people’s security and living standards, at home in the UK, but also across the world. It is the right thing for a leading power to do. And it is squarely within the interests of the British people. As we look out into the world today, there are three dangerous and dominating trends. The first is the fraying of the world order that grew up after World War 2, that seemed stronger than ever just a generation ago. Democracy is in retreat. This decade, the combined GDP of autocratic regimes is expected to exceed the combined GDP of the world’s democracies. Just take a second to think about what that means. Tyranny is richer than freedom. And that matters to us here at home because we know stable, freedom-respecting, democracies are much less likely to go to war, to house terrorists or to trigger large scale flows of immigration. Democracies are generally, not always, but generally easier to trade with and easier to cooperate with to solve our shared problems. That’s the first problem. The second trend is the rise of new threats. We have all become used to talking about asymmetric warfare since 9/11 but technology, twisted to perverse causes, is creating dangerous new weapons which falls short of armed conflict. We know this for ourselves. Three years ago this month, we saw a nerve agent attack on the streets of Salisbury. An attack without a shot being fired. At the same time states, terrorist groups and criminal gangs are exploiting technology to prey on our homes, our businesses and our infrastructure. The third trend of our times is perhaps the most dangerous. That is the rise in what we can only consider as potentially existential threats. Threats to our civilisation, threats to large swathes of the world’s population, or even threats to our planet itself. We see nuclear weapons technology proliferating, a very real risk that it could fall into the hands of people who can’t be reasoned with. We face the possibility of catastrophic climate change, catastrophic pandemics. We can all see how COVID has shown just how interconnected we all are in the modern world. And yet at the same time, for all these threats, now is not a moment to wallow in the counsel of despair. Because there are also equally powerful reasons to feel optimistic about the future for us. For us in the UK but also for the world at large. Our fraying international order can be repaired and reinforced. We can counter these new threats and these new challenges, as we have shown during this pandemic, through the collaboration of scientists to innovate new vaccines. Most of all, I believe we should be optimistic because we see that the flame of human freedom still burns brightly, even at the bleakest moments. You can see that on the streets of Russia, on the streets of Belarus, Myanmar and Hong Kong. Young people risking their lives to stake their claim to the future, demanding democracy, freedom, a better quality of life. Telling the old guard in their palatial offices that a different time is coming. I saw it for myself when I was out in Khartoum in January when I visited the focal point of the 2019 revolution that forced a transition from power, although not before the security forces killed many young protestors. I met some of those protesters, including a young woman called Rifqa Abdelrahman. She became known as the teargas hunter because every time the security forces hurled teargas at the protesters, she raced to pick up the canister and threw it right back at them. She is remarkably brave and I draw courage from hers. She took some time to talk to me about the hopes she and her friends had and their dreams for the future. For all the challenges that a country like Sudan faces, it’s the hope and the courage of those young people give that country a fighting chance, if it gets the international support it sorely needs. And there are many other countries like that today. So, whilst we’ve got to recognise that history doesn’t march in a straight line, that technology can have a dark side, we must also take heart when the future bends towards freedom. I don’t think there’s any inevitability to this, there’s no End of History. But, if we summon the will, and if we galvanise those countries that share our core conviction, together we can and we must wrest control of history once again, and shape a better path ahead. And I believe Britain has a central, driving, role to play in all of this. So, how well equipped are we in Britain to navigate this dangerous but hopeful world? History offers us at least some clues. First, the UK can lead the world in innovation and technology. We were the cradle of the first industrial revolution, that happy combination of intellectual innovation, private capital and public infrastructure. Today, instead of Watt’s steam engine and the Spinning Jenny we have a proliferation of disruptive technologies, AI, quantum computing, biotechnology, the next great economic step forward. The second lesson is that our strongest asset is our people, that includes the way we create communities that come together. After the Great Plague of 1665 it was Daniel Defoe who wrote about how, with work suspended for many, people got through by showing great charity towards one another. I feel that same spirit has marked our country through this pandemic. Our national commitment to the NHS and to carers, a broader spirit of neighbourliness. That has proved a vital source of strength for us, and I think we need to cherish it. But it also marks out our approach to international collaboration, a sense of international civic spirit if you like, and we need that now more than ever. The third lesson from history is the strength of our institutions. Whether it’s the Church of England, Parliament or our armed forces, we have a knack for creating enduring systems that can serve the public. Perhaps our greatest contribution is the rule of law, and the sacred principle, the foundation of order at home and abroad, that’s a particularly British tradition with a global appeal. Don’t just take my word for it. We saw last month the international community elect Karim Khan to be the first British Chief Prosecutor at the International Criminal Court, as well as Judge Joanna Korner, a testament to their credentials, but also to the British brand. So institutions matter at home and abroad. The fourth and final lesson I draw from our history is the overarching need for global engagement. In the UK, particularly as we have come through Brexit, I’m not shy about saying we are a proud, independent nation, but we’re not inward-looking. Sovereignty has never meant isolation. Let’s look at our commitment to free trade. It reflects a deeply-held belief in human exchange as a force for good, and our historic ties with all corners of the world give us a uniquely international perspective. Britain is truly global, and that gives us an edge. These defining characteristics – a scientific, community-minded, law-abiding, outward-looking people - stand us in really good stead for the challenges of our time. But of course history doesn’t just hand you a blueprint to follow, and many of the threats we face today are new. So, what is Britain’s comparative advantage today? Put simply, we’ve got clout. Britain has economic, military, diplomatic, cultural clout. We are the 5th largest economy in the world. The UK is in the top 10 countries in the world for ease of setting up a business. We have produced the largest number of tech Unicorns in Europe. Innovation runs through our DNA. With less than 1% of the world’s population, we are blessed with 6 of the 30 top universities, more Nobel Prize winners than any other country outside the US, and 14% of the most cited research. So that’s economic power. And our hard power is pretty potent too. The UK spends more in cash terms than any other NATO member outside the United States. We are one of only a small number of NATO allies who bring to bear nuclear, cyber, precision strike weapons, 5th generation aircraft, surface and underwater capability alongside an agile manoeuvre division. Our investment in cutting-edge technology will position the UK as a global leader in cyber and space. And that capacity to project force rests on that key characteristic that I have already mentioned, our tradition of internationalism. That’s where our diplomatic clout comes in. We have the 4th largest diplomatic network in the world, reinforced by the second most generous aid budget in the G7 as a percentage of our national income. We have an unparalleled range of expertise to help resolve conflicts and disputes, from Cyprus to Yemen. We are a problem-solving nation and that gives us influence and it gives us reach. And we also have disproportionate cultural influence. I’m not just talking about the English language, it’s what our people do, our artists, our designers, our writers, our sportspeople. The other day, I found my 8-year old son, Peter, watching YouTube and he loves Minecraft. I didn’t really get what it was all about but he was listening to the British gamer Dan Middleton commentating on it. I checked him out. This guy has almost 25 million subscribers around the world. He’s not a one-off. The Great British Bake-Off is watched in 196 countries. The Premier League is the most watched football league in the world. That’s soccer, not American football. And it’s not just about viewing figures, it’s our message, our appeal that really matters. When boxing’s undisputed heavyweight championship of the world is settled, it’s going to be between two Brits, Tyson Fury and Anthony Joshua. When David Attenborough’s latest series goes around the world, it helps shape the global debate on climate, biodiversity and plastic pollution. And it’s those qualities, a global reach, a compelling brand, anchored in a vision of a better world, that help explain why, according to international polling by Ipsos-Mori, the UK is the most attractive country for young people in the world. So we have got some strengths. What use should we put them to? I believe if Global Britain means anything, it means our force is meant for good. Yes we’re a world leader in innovation and tech, but we want that innovation to be a force for good. So we lead in debates on setting down rules and ethical frameworks on human genomics. We can and we should do it again for AI, data and for e-commerce. Last year here in the UK we introduced a UK Magnitsky sanctions law, to target individuals guilty of the most serious human rights abuses abroad. This year, we’re going to go one step further and extend the Magnitsky model to corruption, that scourge of the poorest nations. We took the bold step to issue an invitation to this country to the people of Hong Kong, oppressed by Beijing. We set an example to the world with our contribution to COVAX, the global vaccine programme for the developing world. We are one of the most generous contributors of foreign aid and we were of course the first industrialised nation to set a legally-binding national target to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050. There is a golden thread running through all of this. The UK is not afraid to act, but we prefer to act with others, to form alliances and partnerships that multiply the force, the impact, that we would otherwise be able to bring to bear if we acted on our own. More than that, Global Britain – our concept – is a creative disruptor willing and able to challenge the status quo but in the cause of good order and future stability. A mould-breaker but also a rule-maker, a disruptor for stability if you like. We have got a buccaneering spirit, but we also strive and yearn to build bridges. The challenge is to make the most of our strengths. That is why we brought our aid budget and development policy together with our diplomatic network in the new Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, to drive a more integrated approach, to maximise our impact abroad. In January, I saw what this really means and what this can achieve up close in East Africa. From the UK military support training Kenyan peacekeepers under AMISOM to defeat Al Shabaab, right the way to the school I visited in Addis which we support as part of our campaign to guarantee 12 years of quality education for every girl. It is that unique combination of our hard power and our soft power that is so often a game-changer in those countries that we strive to support in a spirit of partnership. With all of this in mind, the Integrated Review sets out our 4, global, strategic priorities. First, our starting point, forged in the crucible of this pandemic, is to nurture our capacity for scientific and technological innovation. We must harness our comparative advantage in tech and science to create the better paid jobs of the future at home and to boost exports fueled by liberal free trade. That’s key to reinvigorating UK productivity and enhancing the capacity of our start-ups to scale-up. You can already see this being infused and reflected in the Chancellor’s latest budget, from his review of R&D tax credits, to the Super Deduction from business tax bills for capital investment. Our ambition in tech and science will also shape Global Britain’s Indo-Pacific tilt, towards the growth opportunities of the future, and the partnerships that we are going to need to grasp them. So it’s that USP, in tech and science, that will be a defining feature of our second, strategic priority, a pioneering approach to free trade. That’s why the British Trade Secretary Liz Truss has agreed trade deals with 66 countries as well as the EU, and that’s why we’ve launched the UK’s negotiations to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership. To place a new anchor in a part of the world that will provide the most fertile ground for the expansion of UK manufacturing and UK services, including in areas like digital and data. Of course there will be other growth markets too. We look to Africa, in particular the Horn of Africa, we’ll look to the Gulf and South America with renewed ambition and energy. In Africa, our offer will be grounded in the need to provide a more compelling alternative to some of the less scrupulous governments who exact a punitive long-term price for short term investments in things like infrastructure. Put very simply, our offer to Africa will be more liberal on free trade than the EU, do business with greater integrity than the Chinese or Russians, and we’re committed to serve as a force for good in the communities in which we invest. We will do this by combining our trade, our aid, and our values to patiently nurture long term win-win partnerships. Beyond those bilateral trade deals, we have taken up our seat at the WTO under the fresh leadership of the first African, first female Director General. We’re committed to unblocking the vested interests in protectionism, and unleash the power of global free trade to help the world bounce back stronger, and bounce back greener. We recognise in the UK we have got to change the way we do business too. One of the things the pandemic showed up very clearly is the weaknesses of our supply chain model, as every country around the world queued up for PPE and other vital goods from China and a small number of other mass-producing countries. Of course, we embrace the power of the market and we value our trade with China. But we will also develop new partnerships with existing allies, and other High Trust Vendors. We will work with the likes of Estonia and Norway, India and Israel, Singapore and South Korea, and many others, to diversify our supply chains from manufacturing to tech, to shore up our economic resilience. Our science base and our economic resilience are vital elements of the third strategic priority, which is our security. We can do even better in deploying and adapting our lead in science, tech and research to bolster the defences of our business, citizens and our government. Through GCHQ, the National Cyber Security Centre, and our partnerships with business, we are a world-leader in cyber-security. We’ve got the UK’s new National Cyber Force, we are investing to stay ahead of the unholy alliance of hostile states and criminal gangs that prey on our PCs, tablets and our iPhones, whether it is to steal, spy or to spread lies. And the Integrated Review highlights the Janus-facing nature of our investment in tech and science, driving economic productivity and bolstering our security, reinforcing our domestic resilience and demanding more innovative relations with longstanding allies and new partners. That’s why we are increasing our defence spending by £24 billion over the next 4 years. We will restore Britain’s position as the foremost naval power in Europe, and modernise our armed forces. We will be spending nearly £7 billion over next 4 years in R&D, in new areas like space, cyber, AI, quantum tech, and directed energy weapons. That far exceeds our NATO pledge. By the way, for all the talk about the Indo-Pacific, our commitment to NATO is absolute, supporting its adaptation to threats both above and below the threshold of conventional warfare. In the same spirit, we will maintain our nuclear deterrent to counter the most extreme threats to our national security and our way of life. We will continue to adapt to meet the frankly predatory opportunism of states such as Russia, Iran, North Korea and some others. And we will adapt our defence posture to the new shift in the balance of world power towards the Indo-Pacific region. You’ll begin to see that this year, with HMS Queen Elizabeth leading a British and allied task group to the region. The fourth and final strategic priority is the defining feature of Global Britain. The IR provides a road-map, guided by our moral compass, our history, and our present day mission as a force for good in the world. From our inventors to our entrepreneurs, from our diplomats and aid experts to our brave armed forces, all the people involved in delivering Global Britain, share a unifying sense that we are part of a shared planet. We believe that we can and should help alleviate the worst suffering in the world, that we have a moral responsibility and an indivisible stake in our planet, our global economy, our global eco-system and the broader conditions of peace and stability that underpin them. And, whether or not you feel that internationalist impulse, we can surely all of us by now see the cold, hard, evidence, compelling us to take a greater interest and responsibility beyond our shores. Whether it’s Daesh to the plastic polluting our oceans, from COVID to the threat of climate change, it has never been plainer that the UK’s raw national interest, is inextricably bound up in tackling the international challenges that touch us all. The challenges that will define the security, the livelihoods and the happiness of our children, and their children after them. And that is the key to Global Britain. We do it because it is the right thing to do but also because bitter experience shows us that strengthening fragile countries and their people is essential to reduce the terrorist threat and to reduce the migratory flows that arrive in the UK. We feel a moral reflex to exploit our scientific base, not just to vaccinate our own people from COVID, but also to take a lead internationally to make sure an equitable access to vaccines for the most vulnerable countries. It chimes with our sense of justice. But, we also know that this global pandemic requires a global solution, that we won’t be safe until we’re all safe. That will be a major theme of our G7 Presidency this year. This year’s a big year for us, we’ll also be leading on climate change as we bring the world together in Glasgow in November for the COP26 United Nations conference. And I have to say that with the US re-joining the Paris Agreement, and many other countries stepping up to the plate, Japan and South Korea stretching their emissions reduction targets, we sense an opportunity to shift the dial on climate change, phasing out coal and boosting climate finance. Let’s be honest that none of that will be possible without at least some constructive cooperation with China. So we take this challenge on out of a sense of social responsibility in the world, but I think we also see now more than ever, but also due to the tangible impact climate change is having. In all of these different areas, Global Britain is imbued with a sense of responsibility and a desire to help. But we also see the direct gains that we can yield if we can reduce tensions between allies, resolve global problems and bring stability to regions whose prosperity will contribute to our own. I think that’s important – foreign policy in the UK has to stay grounded in the real-life concerns and interests citizens have, whether it is securing the decision by the latest job-creating business to headquarter in Britain, or defending ourselves against the threat from terrorists radicalising the vulnerable online. But it just so happens that many British people also count amongst those very tangible interests the values they hold dear, they expect their government to stand up for freedom, democracy and the rule of law. Because it’s in our DNA, because it’s our compact with the world. And it’s not just about the content of one or other set of international rules, but the very concept to which we feel compelled. We see our maritime interests, from fishing to navigation, reflected in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. We identify with those countries lining the South China Sea whose legitimate claims have come under recent threat from China. This is not just a regional issue, it’s not even just a maritime one. If the terms of a law-making international treaty, bearing the signature of 168 parties can just be junked on a whim, it’s not just an attack on one or other Article or Treaty, it’s a wholesale assault on the system. Now I don’t know, perhaps it was inevitable, after the Cold War, with the economic rise of many developing countries, a good thing, that we would see a re-balancing of global power, that this would translate into pressure to change the international rules. Yet, those governments seeking to ransack the international system remain a minority, albeit a dangerous one. Now I think that is why the Biden Administration’s return to the Paris Agreement and the US’ return to the WHO sends such a powerful message. Because none of us can afford a vacuum in the multilateral institutions where international law is shaped, negotiated and ultimately decided. Nor can we in the West afford disunity, whether it’s holding Iran to its nuclear commitments, holding Russia to account for the use of Novichok, or holding China to its freely assumed international human rights obligations. So, we must re-double our efforts to reinforce transatlantic solidarity. But I think the really urgent imperative we face today is to broaden that consensus in favour of an international system that respects open economies, open societies and promotes public goods. If we are going to rise to the global challenges of COVID and climate change, if we are going to safeguard the international order that reflects a set of progressive liberal values that serve so many of our goals and our interests, we are going to need a concerted effort to bridge the old dividing lines, between the West and the G77, the Global North and the Global South. So let me be clear about it. The UK will remain anchored in NATO, in Five Eyes, a close US ally, a friend of the Gulf, a dependable European neighbour and partner, a passionate member of the Commonwealth. But, Global Britain will also be able and willing to forge and follow agile clusters with like-minded countries, where our values and our interests demand it. That’s why you can see under our Presidency of the G7 that we’ve invited India, South Korea and Australia to join this year’s summit, because we in the West, we have got to broaden our reach and appeal, if we are going to tackle global challenges and manage the threats we face today. And that’s just a start, an organic one if you like, building on a traditional G7 format. But it must be part of, a conscious broadening of the caucus of nations who feel committed to reforming but also safeguarding an order grounded in rules and a conception of the common good. These are just the core tenets that will guide Global Britain for the coming decade, but they are crucial. A focus on science and tech yes to make Britain richer, but also to help the world develop good ethics around AI, genomics, the internet. A commitment to free trade to create British jobs, but also to offer the developing world a more compelling model of economic growth than debt servitude. A clear and unequivocal commitment to security to defend the British people, but also to build up better governance in countries abroad. And an absolute commitment to be a force for good in the world, to help the global south, but also to expand British interests. Now let me finish with a pledge. US Secretary of State Dean Acheson described foreign policy in the post-war era as like being ‘present at the creation’ of a new world. Well I believe we bear an equally humbling responsibility today. So today the British government undertakes to work with our allies, to do whatever it takes to make that new world a better one for all of our people, and for the planet itself. Because if these islands, if this rainy archipelago off the European coast, has a particular destiny, it’s surely to act as a beacon of hope at home and abroad, to fight for peace and prosperity, to defeat the enemies of mankind, and to act as a force for good. That is our mission. That’s our promise. Thank you very much. Read the Integrated Foreign Policy Review, Global Britain in a Competitive Age."
"Boris Johnson","PM statement at coronavirus press conference: 18 March 2021","18 March 2021","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-statement-at-coronavirus-press-conference-18-march-2021","Our roadmap to freedom depends on the continued success of our vaccination programme, and so it is reasonable for people to want to be continually reassured not only that our vaccines are safe and effective but also that we have the supply that we need. So I want to address both points today especially in the light of concerns you may have heard in some other countries about the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine. First, the independent Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency has reviewed the evidence, as it does every week. They have confirmed that the benefits of the vaccine in preventing COVID far outweigh any risks and people should continue to get their vaccine when asked to do so and June will say a little bit more about that in a moment. It’s also very important for our European friends that today the European Medicines Agency has come to a clear scientific conclusion and I quote - “this is a safe and effective vaccine.” We also saw yesterday the evidence from Public Health England that a single dose of either vaccine provides 60 per cent protection against getting COVID. and reduces the chances of hospitalisation by 80 per cent and the risk of death by 85 per cent. So the Oxford jab is safe; and the Pfizer jab is safe – the thing that isn’t safe is catching Covid – which is why it’s so important that we all get our jabs as soon as our turn comes. And as it happens, I’m getting mine tomorrow. And the centre where I’m getting jabbed is currently using the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine for those receiving their first dose, and that is the one I’ll be having. And let me also assure you – if you come forwards after receiving your letter, we have the jabs for you. We’ve always said that in a vaccination programme of this pace and this scale, some interruptions in supply are inevitable and it is true that in the short term we are receiving fewer vaccines than we had planned for a week ago. That is because of a delay in a shipment from the Serum Institute who are doing a herculean job in producing vaccines in such large quantities - and because of a batch that we currently have in the UK that needs to be retested – as part of our rigorous safety programmes. So as a result we will receive slightly fewer vaccines in April than in March. But that is still more than we received in February and the supply we do have will still enable us to hit the targets we have set. That means that by 15 April we will be able to offer a first dose to all of you who are over 50, as well as those under 50 who are clinically vulnerable. We will have the second doses that people need within the 12 week window – which means around 12 million people in April. And we will still offer a first dose to every adult by the end of July. So there is no change to the next steps of the roadmap. We’ve now vaccinated over 25 million across our entire United Kingdom – more than the entire population of many countries and our progress along the road to freedom continues unchecked. We remain on track to reclaim the things we love, to see our families and friends again, to return to our local pubs, our gyms and sports facilities, and of course our shops, all as long as the data continue to go in the right direction and we meet our four tests. And the way to ensure this happens is to get that jab when your turn comes. So let’s get the jab done! Thank you very much."
"Boris Johnson","PM statement at coronavirus press conference: 23 March 2021","23 March 2021","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-statement-at-coronavirus-press-conference-23-march-2021","Good afternoon everybody, thank you for joining us, When I asked you to go into lockdown exactly a year ago it seemed incredible that in the 21st Century this was the only way to fight a new respiratory disease - to stay at home to avoid human contact to shun so many of the patterns of behaviour that are most natural and obvious to all of us. But we did it together to protect the NHS to save lives. And for the entire British people it has been an epic of endurance and privation, of children’s birthday parties cancelled of weddings postponed of family gatherings of all kinds simply deleted from the diary. And worst of all in that time We’ve suffered so many losses and for so many people our grief has been made more acute because we have not been able to see our loved ones in their final days to hold their hands or even to mourn them together. And at the right moment, we will come together as a country to build a fitting and a permanent memorial to the loved ones we have lost and to commemorate this whole period. For month after month our collective fight against Coronavirus was like fighting in the dark against a callous and invisible enemy, until science helped us to turn the lights on and to gain the upper hand. And I want to renew my thanks to everyone responsible for the astounding vaccine roll-out which has enabled us to protect more than 28 million people across the whole of the United Kingdom with a first jab and administer more than 30 million doses in total. And I want to thank everybody for their courage, your courage, discipline and patience. When people come to describe this epidemic to future generations, we’ll tell the story of the heroes of the NHS and social care of pharmacists, teachers, armed service personnel, shop workers, transport workers, the police and so many others. But in the end this was unlike any other struggle in my lifetime, in that our entire population has been engaged, and it’s thanks to all of you therefore that we can continue on our roadmap to freedom. We will meet our targets, offering a first dose to everyone over 50 by the middle of next month, as well as those under 50 who are clinically vulnerable, and offering a first dose of the vaccine to every adult by the end of July. And cautiously but irreversibly, step by step, jab by jab, this country is on the path to reclaiming our freedoms."

Thank you. In July, President Joe Biden said: “When I hear the words climate change, I hear the word ‘jobs’.” In November, Prime Minister Boris Johnson published a ten point plan for a Green Industrial Revolution, mobilising £12 billion of investment and supporting up to 250,000 British jobs to achieve net zero. We have shared goals. The Environment Agency, which I chair, manages floods and droughts in England, and is part of the International Network for Storm Surge Barriers, or I-STORM, alongside the US Army Corps of Engineers and others. I-STORM allows authorities operating storm surge barriers to peer review each other’s work and share best practice. The Thames Barrier and its associated defences in London protect over 1.4 million people, and half a million properties worth over £321 billion. I-STORM shows that international collaboration is extremely valuable, even when it comes to unique place-based climate challenges. Storm surge barriers are important for protecting hubs of economic activity, but that economic activity itself has a role to play. - In 2018, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said we have 12 years to hold global warming to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels. In 2019, the insurance giant Aviva measured investments in its equities portfolios against the goals of the 2015 Paris agreement, and found they are on track for a 3.4 degree rise, and the FTSE 100 index as a whole was heading towards 3.9 degrees. For many people who are investors, mainly via pensions, this looks like a Catch-22… You need to save, yet your savings are contributing to a world that will be much less hospitable by the time you retire. - But things are changing – fast. Earlier this month, the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change launched a framework to help global investor groups align their portfolios with net zero. The launch saw 22 asset owners, with $1.2 trillion in assets, joining a number of others already working on net zero alignment. This means 38 investors, managing $8.5 trillion in assets are already putting the Framework to practical use. Stephanie Pfeifer, CEO of IIGCC, said: “The global investment community has been called on to play its part in the transition to net zero – and it is answering that call”. - A new initiative led by the filmmaker Richard Curtis – called Make My Money Matter - is encouraging people in the UK to make sure their pension reflects their values. Moving to a more sustainable fund can have 27 times as much impact in reducing your carbon footprint than giving up flying and becoming a vegan combined. That doesn’t mean that those choices are 27 times less important - far from it - but the Make My Money Matter campaign has found out that 68 percent of UK savers want their investments to consider people and planet alongside profit. The Financial Times reports that – according to Morningstar financial data – global Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance-linked funds took in nearly $350 billion last year, compared with $165 billion in 2019. It said net assets held in UK-domiciled ESG funds went from £29 billion at the beginning of 2017 to £71 billion by the end of 2020, including active and passive funds. - What does that mean on the ground? It means we need to BOTH reduce carbon emissions and take action to prepare for physical impacts. Let’s start with one vast, complex and vital global industry. Construction is one of the biggest emitters of carbon world-wide, but many in that industry would say that their clients’ priority is bringing costs down, not taking climate action. But, no one who works in construction wants to build wind turbines that freeze in a Texas ice storm, or build energy efficient homes that could wash away in an Australian flood. They want to build things that last. Do you remember the Oscar ceremony when Frances McDormand won best actress for Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri? She proposed actors should demand an “inclusion rider”. I propose everybody should demand a “climate emergency rider”. If you are commissioning work from any industry you should ask how that work is actively reducing carbon emissions, and how it is resilient to the coming shocks – like storms and heatwaves. If the answer is “the technology hasn’t been invented yet” - that’s not good enough. A business that pins all their hopes on the R&D department is a risky investment. Greta Thunberg has talked about “cathedral thinking” and that means we must lay the first stone without knowing exactly how to construct the ceiling. At the Environment Agency, we are using our activities and supply chain as a laboratory to find new ways to reach net zero, such as low carbon concrete for flood defences. This helps us protect people from climate shocks, and it reduces our carbon footprint at the same time. If the whole industry began using low-carbon concrete – and I predict they will – the carbon reductions would be huge. But, the most successful companies can’t afford to wait for everyone else. They will get ahead of that trend and raise the bar. - Bill Gates said the climate emergency is even more difficult to manage than coronavirus. Some organisations, like the Environment Agency, are working with behavioural psychologists to help us overcome the natural human barriers that get in the way. It will expose vulnerabilities and require courage. But consider this: In Bangladesh, deaths from tropical cyclones declined more than 100-fold in 40 years, from 500,000 deaths in 1970 to just over 4,000 in 2007. This was made possible by developments in early warning systems, cyclone shelters, evacuation plans, coastal embankments, reforestation schemes, and increased awareness and communication. We need to mobilise the finance industry to get behind change on the ground. - The Coalition for Climate Resilient Investment was launched in 2019, and has three co-Chairs: John Haley, CEO of the Anglo-American insurance company Willis Towers Watson; Samir Assaf, Chair of Corporate and Institutional Banking at HSBC; And, me. By pricing climate risks (particularly for infrastructure) and including them in upfront financial decision-making, our aim is to incentivise a shift towards greater resilience. The State of California recently joined the Coalition, and members now have over £11 trillion in assets. That’s what is needed. Trillions. - In the UK Government’s recent Budget, the Chancellor confirmed the creation of a new National Infrastructure Bank. It will have £22 billion of financial capacity, is expected to support at least £40 billion of investment in infrastructure projects, and one of its core objectives will be to help tackle climate change. Green banks are critical. They allow countries access to foreign and domestic climate finance while enabling domestic ownership of project development, and alignment with the Paris Agreement. Research from the Rocky Mountain Institute, the Natural Resources Defense Council, and – in the UK - the Green Finance Institute, has shown that there are 27 operational green banks in 12 countries that have invested over $25 billion of their own capital, and attracted twice as much from the private sector into low-carbon and resilient projects. UK and US support for the expansion of national green banks would demonstrate a commitment to green recovery globally, and would help establish a world-leading platform that provides international support. - There is extraordinary economic opportunity in tackling the climate crisis and restoring nature. But, to underpin this we need strong environmental regulation. If polluters don’t pay, the best intentions of the best performers will be undermined – and undercut. Environmental regulation needs to be in lockstep with economic and financial regulation, outpacing climate change and matching the scale of the challenge. Environmental regulation – through its example, enforcement, monitoring and metrics – can support profitable green industry both at home and demonstrate market effectiveness everywhere, so that no country – and no one - gets left behind. - The United States and the United Kingdom should be united in getting the whole world invested in restoring nature, reducing carbon emissions, preparing for shocks, and creating the jobs of the future As we approach the G7 and COP26 - let’s together kick start a global race to the trillions of dollars needed to do just that. Thank you very much."

"Boris Johnson","Lord Chancellor’s Speech: Law and politics - the nightmare and the noble dream","25 March 2021","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/lord-chancellors-speech-law-and-politics-the-nightmare-and-the-noble-dream","Introduction and the role of the Lord Chancellor Thank you, Richard [Johnson, School of Politics and International Relations, QMUL]. It’s a pleasure to join you and everyone online. It has been claimed on various occasions, most recently by my friend and colleague the Lord President of the Council and Leader of the House of Commons that one expert on the constitution believes, and I quote, that it ‘has always been puzzling and always will be.’ I say quote because the expert in question is no less than Her Majesty the Queen. But I think I had better leave it there for the sake of well-known propriety. Let me start by saying how grateful I am to the School of Politics and International Relations for the invitation, and to Queen Mary University for the opportunity to speak today as we continue to puzzle over our constitution. Now, those who are privileged to serve as Lord Chancellor have, I believe, a unique responsibility with regard to our constitutional arrangements. As part of the Executive, the Lord Chancellor naturally wants the government to be as effective as possible in delivering on its agenda – we should not apologise or be defensive about that in any way, it is what voters expect from their government frankly. But at the same time, the Lord Chancellor has an important – a vital – duty to protect the Judiciary, not just in the single jurisdiction of England and Wales, but throughout our United Kingdom. For instance, the Lord Chancellor retains the power to determine the remuneration of specified judicial offices in Scotland and Northern Ireland, the rationale being that this goes to the unique constitutional position of the Lord Chancellor and their duty to uphold the independence of the Judiciary throughout the UK – without compromising, of course, the integrity of those three separate and historic jurisdictions. The Lord Chancellor’s role is also to champion those aspects of the three different legal systems that they share in common, namely an excellent Judiciary and a top-quality legal profession; to promote the value of the UK justice system on the global stage and the values that have made it such a success. So, the Lord Chancellor is therefore very much a UK-wide role. As our system continues to evolve to serve the needs of our citizens, as it has over many centuries, the delicate balance between our institutions and the ways in which they interact between the nations of the United Kingdom inevitably requires fine tuning. The Lord Chancellor has a vital role to play in carrying out that work and, as the current holder of the office, I am taking forward a series of reviews to examine the balance in different contexts. As you will know, last year I set up the Independent Review of Administrative Law. And I am pleased to say that the Panel has produced a fine report, which analysed the trends seen in judicial review over the previous decades, as well as evaluating the diverse views that are held about them. And a week ago, I launched a consultation outlining my proposals for reform which emanate from the Panel’s recommendations. The ongoing Independent Review of the Human Rights Act chaired by Sir Peter Gross that was established earlier this year recently held a call for evidence, as many of you will know. Now, that review is concerned with the operation of the various aspects of the Human Rights Act and I look forward to reading the Panel’s report, so that the government can consider how to respond. Finally, I want to examine the role of the Lord Chancellor itself, in the context of the Constitutional Reform Act of 2005. Now, the Act brought in some sensible reforms, such as a greater degree of transparency in judicial appointments, but there are strands that are worth examining – to ensure that they have kept pace with the developments and continue to provide the appropriate framework for the Lord Chancellor to exercise their duties in respect of our constitutional arrangements. We are still in the early stages of that thinking and I am clear that I want to consider these matters in an open and consultative way. I look forward to talking about this in more detail in due course, but I do think there are elements that feed into the specifics of what I want to talk about today and that are worth considering first. In the days when the Lord Chancellor was not only a Parliamentarian and a Cabinet Minister, but also sat on the bench and appointed all their judicial colleagues, the role was often described as a ‘linchpin’ that linked all three branches of the state and managed the relationships between them. Now Walter Bagehot was somewhat unimpressed with this arrangement, describing the role as ‘a heap of anomalies’. My predecessor, Ken, now Lord Clarke, said the role was difficult to explain to people in other political systems as it ‘sounded like something… made up’. The only other Lord Chancellor to have hailed from my home town of Llanelli, Lord Elwyn-Jones, described it perhaps as only he could in a more kindly way as, and I quote, ‘an object of wonderment and perplexity’. The Lord Chancellor today As you will know, the Constitutional Reform Act of 2005 made sweeping reforms to the office of Lord Chancellor, the extent of which was brought home to me when on assuming office in 2019 I was obliged to resign my position as a Recorder of the Crown Court, a part-time judge. The Act aimed to answer questions about separation of powers, but the reality is that we do not have a perfectly neat and defined separation of state powers – and I say amen to that. As a Tory, I accept and I embrace the imperfections of the human condition and indeed of government. Now, instead we have a system which is based on checks and balances. By changing the role of the Lord Chancellor in the ways that the previous government did – remaining as part of the Legislature and the Executive but no longer the Judiciary – we have lost the sense of the office being the linchpin between all three that I mentioned just a few moments ago. It is worth reminding ourselves that contrary to regular commentary Parliament today is not in my view the supine body it has been at times. It is better informed by the way outside bodies interact with it; it is a stronger scrutinising body in my view certainly since the Tony Wright reforms; and more recently since 2016 it has demonstrated an ability to flex its muscles on issues of huge national importance. It is no longer the Victorian child, someone who is seen and not heard. The fact that Parliament frankly matters a lot more today and is more assertive than it once was, is to be celebrated in a healthy democracy such as ours. While it doesn’t necessarily make the day-to-day work of politics any more straightforward, I frankly very much value the effect that it has on our ability to make better law – for instance the kind of cross-party working we have seen on the Domestic Abuse Bill of late. Since 2007 Lord Chancellors have been drawn from the House of Commons, which means that they are much more in the hurly burly of politics, with responsibilities amongst others for piloting legislation through the House – indeed just last week I made the closing arguments for the Government in the Second Reading of the Police, Crime, Sentencing, and Courts Bill. And at the same time as taking on all of these responsibilities on behalf of the Executive within the Legislature, the role of Lord Chancellor continues to demand that those who hold the office remain detached from partisan politics in their duty to defend the Judiciary. Now, the one benefit to no longer themselves being a member of the Judiciary is that the Lord Chancellor is able to offer, shall we say, much more detached commentary in upholding their oath to defend it. This is particularly helpful in discussing the question of where power lies in our country. So, let’s look then at each of these institutions. Firstly, the Executive. The role of a modern Lord Chancellor can only be understood in the light of a modern government, and it seems to me that modern government is caught between two positions: firstly, that of constant suspicion about executive power and secondly one of constant expectation about the need for Government to assume that very power to ‘take swift action’. And nowhere is this more obvious than in the adoption of secondary legislative powers as a basis of lawful activity, and in the ability via secondary powers to amend primary legislation, the so-called Henry VIII power. And indeed, the current pandemic has thrown this issue in to stark relief. Government has imposed legislative restrictions on the clear understanding that they are to be temporary only, with reviews and sunset clauses to assure every one of their intentions. Suspicion remains, however. There is an historical hangover perhaps from the Civil War struggle between Parliament and the Crown, or rather, between Parliament and a particular interpretation of prerogative power, namely the Divine Right of Kings – and we still live with tensions between different arms of the state today. I won’t deny that there have been instances in ancient and indeed more modern political times where governments have overreached and have had to be checked. Governments are not perfect, but neither generally speaking do they have that insatiable appetite to ever expand their power and reach. Now this argument has been described to me by its opponents as somewhat redolent of the way in which Frederick the Great described the attitude of Empress Maria Theresa of Austria on the partition of Poland in the 1770s – and I quote: ‘She cried, when she took; the more she cried, the more she took.’ I see the point, but frankly it misunderstands motive. The idea that governments of all hues are on a ceaseless mission to expand their power is, frankly, for the birds. Government is very often all too glad to share or cede responsibility. It is constantly faced with cries of ‘there ought to be a law against it’, and when it acts to address those calls, often it accrues a little more authority and a little more power. And of course, this has consequences. Government has to constantly balance the need for action with its actual capacity to deliver. This is the real struggle and is the true explanation for the reluctance of Government in many instances to seek more power. Because with more power comes more responsibility, and with more responsibility comes more financial cost. This in itself is, in my view, a key check against unrestrained Government and ‘elective dictatorship’, so well written about by my predecessor, Lord Hailsham. And there are many other restraints, both formal and practical. Modern Government is more Prometheus bound than unbound. Hart’s Lecture So, when it comes to the Judiciary, its role and its approach, nowhere do these issues become more pertinent than in the area of judicial review. I think it is helpful from my vantage point, uniquely connected to the Judiciary but no longer of it, to consider issues raised by none other than Professor HLA Hart, one of the foremost legal philosophers of the last century, in his 1977 Sibley lecture at the University of Georgia, and it was entitled ‘American Jurisprudence through English eyes: The Nightmare and the Noble Dream’1. And in addressing the question of adjudication, especially higher court judges, Hart explained that there were two views on how the courts approach such a task, which he termed the Nightmare and the Noble Dream. And setting aside the purist view that, when faced with a dispute, judges simply apply existing law and do not create new law, Hart saw two extremes: firstly, the Nightmare of judges deciding dockets of moral and political questions, and then the Dream of judges threading fundamental principles through every case. Now the Nightmare in Hart’s scenario and I quote ‘is that this image of the judge, distinguishing him from the legislator, is an illusion, and the expectations which it excites are doomed to disappointment – on an extreme view, always, and on a moderate view, very frequently.’ 2 Now if of course adjudication were a true form of law-making, rather than the application of existing laws, this would lead to worrying questions about how the far judges’ personally held views could form the basis of their legal decision-making. An easy defence is that here in the United Kingdom not only do we do avoid selecting our judges with regard to their personal political views, but our constitution does not allow for primary legislation to be struck down by the courts. The very existence of the sovereignty of Parliament is at odds with the idea that judges could ever act as legislators and ‘create’ law, but as I shall return to, the core idea of the nightmare – that judges are placed into the position of legislators or political decision makers – is not unimaginable. Hart’s Noble Dream is the belief that – even when the law appears unclear or there exists no precedent, judges can apply existing law and underlying principles and I quote ‘which if consistently applied, would yield a determinate result’ 3 to their cases – to do so without creating new law. Now whether this dream can be said to apply in the UK of course is questionable, given, as I shall return to, our legal systems can contain conflicting principles, and there may be a number of legal sources which could be examined in seeking clarification. Judges are then left in the unenviable position of having to make law-making choices. Hart concludes ultimately that the truth – as with so many things in life – is somewhere in the middle. In many cases judges simply apply the law, but in others they have a discretionary field of judgement and actually have a choice to make about what the law should be. As Hart put it and I quote: ‘It is not of course a matter of indifference but of very great importance which they do and when and how they do it.’ 4 Morpheus or Epiales in Britain Whilst Hart was speaking of the United States, quite a separate and distinct jurisdiction to ours, it is useful nearly 50 years on to consider where Britain stands on Hart’s oneiric spectrum – and how the modern Lord Chancellor should react. Before the Supreme Court heard the appeal in the first Miller case, a newspaper carried a feature analysing how supposedly ‘Europhile’ the 11 judges were. The rating of each was based upon their formal links to European institutions, any views they publicly expressed that seemed to be sympathetic to the EU, and their close links to individuals who themselves might be pro-EU 5. In the end, there was no correlation whatsoever between the rating given and the way in which way the judges ruled. Lord Sumption, imagined to be the only Eurosceptic, ruled with the majority; whilst Lords Carnwath and Reed, each imagined to be a Europhile, dissented. In this case, the Nightmare proved to be just that – a nightmare and a rather ridiculous one at that, but not at all easy for the judges whose integrity was impugned and who could not defend themselves. At the same time the Noble Dream – the view that judges do nothing more than interpret and apply the law – is frequently aired in our country. For example, the former President of the Law Society said, and I quote: ‘A judge’s ruling is an expression of the law – not of their personal opinion. It would be disingenuous to conflate the two.’6 However, I am not the first to consider that this is not always true in every case. In an interesting lecture last year Lord Sales described R (Nicklinson) v Secretary of State for Justice as and I quote ‘a case literally involving questions of life and death, which called for a decision which balanced competing fundamental moral values. It also called for a decision which balanced competing fundamental institutional values in terms of whether the court should or should not strike the balance of moral values itself or accept the balance as struck by Parliament.’ 7 Now the judges of the Supreme Court, holding the highest legal offices in the land were not of one mind on what was the first order question here and how it should be answered. Now if the courts had to answer moral and not legal questions themselves, wholly different from the sorts of questions which even the apex courts are accustomed to considering, this raises questions of what the proper description of the judicial role should be, how the government and Parliament should relate to them and how the Lord Chancellor – me – how I should defend them. I do not think it is controversial to say that there are questions on which a court should not be required to adjudicate. And on one famous occasion a former Chief Justice, Sir Edward Coke told James I that no level of natural reasoning abilities made the king qualified to decide a case personally. And Coke of course distinguished between natural reason and I quote ‘accessible to individual rational minds’ and by which ‘law is measured’ 8 , and artificial reason – technical, legal reasoning which requires long study of the law. On this analysis, legislators use natural reason, but judges use artificial reason and this distinction is an important one in determining what is being asked of our Judiciary and so, in turn, how the Lord Chancellor should act. Now without wanting to get into a debate about whether everyone is equally good at natural reason, there is no objective metric by which it can be measured. And, even if there were, judges in the UK are not appointed on that basis. And as the late US Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia pointed out of his own bench, they would have no more, and indeed likely had less, legitimacy to decide a moral question than nine randomly selected citizens – an inference which must be true even of our great Judiciary 9. In a jurisdiction where a body of law lay out the settled moral and philosophical view of the nation and catered for all possible scenarios then no judge would ever be asked to exercise their own discretion. Despite the work of codifiers from Hammurabi through to Justinian to Napoleon, such a jurisdiction has never existed and indeed in the increasing complexity of the modern world seems further away than ever. The United States has pursued a solution of considering the moral, political, and philosophical dispositions of would-be judges in the appointment process. And we’ve all seen the results of that. As Lord Chancellor I feel that this would indeed be a nightmare for the UK, which we should seek to avoid. Imagine if the newspaper story I mentioned earlier had been about the judges’ views on Assisted Suicide – here we are back to the nightmare once again. But how best can the modern Lord Chancellor use their roles in the Executive, Legislature and as advocate and defender of the Judiciary to avoid that very nightmare? The Intention of Parliament In her response to the Independent Review of Administrative Law call for evidence, the Noble Lady, Baroness Hale wrote and I quote that ‘in the vast majority of cases, Judicial Review is the servant of Parliament’. In this Kingdom we in Government – the Executive and the Judiciary – are all servants of Parliament, which derives its authority from the people. But how do we know what it wants – particularly how it wants the Executive and the Judiciary to treat each other? When Parliament grants a power to the Executive it also sets limits to how it can be used – these are the familiar grounds of judicial review. Now how those limits apply in a particular case essentially comes down to a question of statutory interpretation: did Parliament intend for the decision maker to have the power to do it? The courts should not imply any limitations on a power which Parliament did not actually intend; and if Parliament intended not to put in some limitations, the of course this must be respected. There is a cautionary tale to be found in the case of Roberts v Hopwood, where the Appellate Committee of the House of Lords held that the powers Parliament granted to Local Authorities had the implied condition that they should be exercised in accordance with a so-called fiduciary duty towards ratepayers. Using this limitation of power that they had just discovered, the courts decided that a council could not set a minimum wage for its employees. So much so, that this rule was nicknamed by some mischievous souls as ‘the rule against socialism’! The powers of local government have of course changed since then, but the legal problem of a constitutional problem raised is not simply theoretical. On the other hand, the continued failure of the courts to give full effect to ouster clauses is a cause for concern. As Lord Chancellor I have sought to ensure that Parliament’s instructions are clearer to both the Executive and the Judiciary. Although I am no longer personally a law officer of the Crown, I have a duty to uphold the rule of law. The Independent Review of Administrative Law Panel said that ouster clauses, when they are used in relation to specific decisions and powers, do not contravene the rule of law, and so should be upheld. Nonetheless, we are yet to see an ouster clause where Parliament was held to have been clear enough in its language to be given full effect by the courts. Indeed, even the previous Government with a majority north of 150 at one stage ran into problems in attempting to get an ouster clause through Parliament that sought to clarify the law in the broadest terms possible. So, I believe it is now time for Parliament to clarify its instructions to the courts in this situation, and so we are consulting on proposals on how ouster clauses should be interpreted by our courts, and to ensure Parliament’s intentions are observed. Now more generally, the risk of the Nightmare arises most commonly from legislation which lacks the kind of clarity that the rule of law demands in a modern and mature democracy like ours. A legal system as complex and advanced as ours will always fills gaps in legislation – and that is in the interests of litigants. We must be honest about the fact that rushed and poorly drafted legislation leaves those gaps and judges frankly have an unenviable task in filling them. At best it is a Parliament shirking its duty which leaves jurists uncertain of whether it did or did not intend a certain outcome, at worst it is contracting out its own decision-making function. Frankly that tendency only creates more problems for those who must interpret the law. Governments of all complexions have a clear responsibility to draft better, clearer laws that protect the Judiciary from having the responsibility to do our jobs for us. And it must surely be an important part of the role of the modern Lord Chancellor to be the keenest advocate in government of precise and clear legislation. As a cabinet minister I have the tools to challenge my colleagues to produce only the best legislation, but as in all things I cannot guarantee perfection. It is particularly acute when our domestic law interacts with another jurisdiction. In the EU the CJEU’s supremacy was the extreme answer to this tension between the Union and member states. New case law of the CJEU is of course no longer a matter for our courts, but how to maintain clarity for the courts was amongst the most technically and politically fraught parts of legislating for our exit. In the Strasbourg Court the evolution of the convention and our domestic law has increased the complexity and decreased the clarity of the law in cases like Nicklinson. It is in this vein that I have asked Sir Peter Gross to review the operation of the Human Rights Act. Like the rest of you I am awaiting the report and do not wish to pre-judge it, but I am hoping for recommendations which will lead to greater clarity for the courts and which I can, as Lord Chancellor, ask Parliament to approve. As I have said, achieving that clarity is a responsibility placed upon me and on the Government, but each institution of the state has a responsibility to maintain and respect balance in our system. Writing about the recent decision of the Supreme Court in the Shamima Begum case – where the Court made the determination that ministers are better equipped to make decisions relating to national security and that resolving such matters through litigation lacked democratic legitimacy – one of its former members, Lord Sumption, noted that it marked and I quote ‘a return to a more cautious approach to the judicial control of ministerial decisions.’ 10 You might say that I am bound, as a minister in the government that made the decision being challenged in the case, to agree with him. But his assessment – that it goes some way to restoring a balance between Parliament and the courts which understands the realities and the proper role of each institution within a democracy – has much more to say about the ongoing relationship between the Executive and the Judiciary than it does about the decisions of the current government. Conclusion As a modern Lord Chancellor my duties are to properly balance our constitutional arrangements, and so to protect the Judiciary. To maintain a clear delineation about where the power lies, it falls to me to propose reforms which, as far as possible, avoid drawing judges into the political realm and forcing them to adjudicate on moral or philosophical issues. The best solution is to avoid getting into this situation in the first place by Parliament taking the lead and ensuring that the discretionary field of judgement is appropriately construed. And I quite agree with Lord Sales that when faced with an unclear statutory provision the court should seek to construe it by, and I quote, ‘looking to infer what the legislating Parliament would have decided had it addressed itself directly to the issue at hand.’ 11 But in doing so the courts should not be asked to replace Parliament’s reasoning with their own. The responsibility to avoid dragging the courts into moral and political issues lies not solely with the judges. Parliament and the Executive also has a vital role in this regard. We must confront the fact that there have been instances where Parliament glossed over its own divisions by passing legislation that was vague and which had the effect (if not the intention) of exporting the determination of certain moral or political issues to judges. I want us to be clear about where power lies and why; and to strike a balance in our constitutional arrangements – on which issues the courts should adjudicate, and in doing so how they should adjudicate them. In doing so, I am not seeking to grab power for myself or for the Executive and I reject the notion that government is something to be mistrusted fundamentally. But getting the right balance – not just in this constitutional question but right across the board – is, I believe, a fundamental duty placed upon the Lord Chancellor by virtue of their unique role. And it is one that I have begun with the work I have referenced over the last 18 months and I intend to use all the tools at my disposal. And beyond this I look forward to saying much more in the near future about how it will be possible to achieve a balance that reflects the realities of the modern justice system and the world in which we live today. The truth is that neither the Executive, nor the judges are, to borrow a regrettable and wholly wrong headline, ‘Enemies of the People’. Far from it, we are both the servants of Parliament and the people. And in that common endeavour the balance of our constitution will be maintained. Thank you.

"Boris Johnson","No government can address the threat of pandemics alone – we must come together","29 March 2021","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/no-government-can-address-the-threat-of-pandemics-alone-we-must-come-together","The Covid-19 pandemic is the biggest challenge to the global community since the 1940s. At that time, following the devastation of two world wars, political leaders came together to forge the multilateral system. The aims were clear – to bring countries together, to dispel the temptations of isolationism and nationalism and to address the challenges that could only be achieved together in the spirit of solidarity and co-operation, namely peace, prosperity, health and security. Today we hold the same hope that, as we fight to overcome the Covid-19 pandemic together, we can build a more robust international health architecture that will protect future generations. There will be other pandemics and other major health emergencies. No single government or multilateral agency can address this threat alone. The question is not if, but when. Together, we must be better prepared to predict, prevent, detect, assess and effectively respond to pandemics in a highly co-ordinated fashion. The Covid-19 pandemic has been a stark and painful reminder that nobody is safe until everyone is safe. We are, therefore, committed to ensuring universal and equitable access to safe, efficacious and affordable vaccines, medicines and diagnostics for this and future pandemics. Immunisation is a global public good and we will need to be able to develop, manufacture and deploy vaccines as quickly as possible. This is why the Access to Covid-19 Tools Accelerator (ACT-A) was set up in order to promote equal access to tests, treatments and vaccines and support health systems across the globe. ACT-A has delivered on many aspects, but equitable access is not achieved yet. There is more we can do to promote global access. To that end, we believe that nations should work together towards a new international treaty for pandemic preparedness and response. Such a renewed collective commitment would be a milestone in stepping up pandemic preparedness at the highest political level. It would be rooted in the constitution of the World Health Organisation, drawing in other relevant organisations key to this endeavour, in support of the principle of health for all. Existing global health instruments, especially the International Health Regulations, would underpin such a treaty, ensuring a firm and tested foundation on which we can build and improve. The main goal of this treaty would be to foster an all of government and all of society approach, strengthening national, regional and global capacities and resilience to future pandemics. This includes greatly enhancing international co-operation to improve, for example, alert systems, data-sharing, research and local, regional and global production and distribution of medical and public health counter-measures such as vaccines, medicines, diagnostics and personal protective equipment. It would also include recognition of a “One Health” approach that connects the health of humans, animals and our planet. And such a treaty should lead to more mutual accountability and shared responsibility, transparency and co-operation within the international system and with its rules and norms. To achieve this, we will work with heads of state and governments globally, and all stakeholders including civil society and the private sector. We are convinced that it is our responsibility, as leaders of nations and international institutions, to ensure that the world learns the lessons of the Covid-19 pandemic. At a time when Covid-19 has exploited our weaknesses and divisions, we must seize this opportunity and come together as a global community for peaceful co-operation that extends beyond this crisis. Building our capacities and systems to do this will take time and require a sustained political, financial and societal commitment over many years. Our solidarity in ensuring that the world is better prepared will be our legacy that protects our children and grandchildren and minimises the impact of future pandemics on our economies and our societies. Pandemic preparedness needs global leadership for a global health system fit for this millennium. To make this commitment a reality, we must be guided by solidarity, fairness, transparency, inclusiveness and equity. Authors: J. V.

"Boris Johnson","PM statement at coronavirus press conference: 29 March 2021","29 March 2021","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-statement-at-coronavirus-press-conference-29-march-2021","Good afternoon and welcome to this press conference on what has been a big day for many of us – with the first chance to see friends and family outdoors, whether as six people or two households. And I want to congratulate the members of Ilkeston cycling club in Derbyshire that set off at midnight, the swimmers who broached the chilly waters of the Hillingdon Lido at the crack of dawn, and more than anything I know how much it will have meant to millions of people to have joined someone else for a cup of tea in the garden. And I must stress that it is only because of months of sacrifice and effort that we can take this small step to freedom today. And we must proceed with caution. It is great to see that yesterday we recorded the lowest number of new infections for six months deaths and hospital admissions across the UK are continuing to fall. But that wave is still rising across the Channel and it is inevitable as we advance on this roadmap that there will be more infections, and unavoidably more hospitalisations and sadly more deaths. So what we need to do is continue flat out to build the immunity of our population build our defences against that wave when it comes. And now that we have vaccinated more than 30 million adults across the United Kingdom it is more vital than ever to protect the most vulnerable. the evidence seems pretty clear that vaccinating the elderly and vulnerable has helped to drive down rates of hospitalisation and death and now we want to reinforce that protection with a second dose so for many people April will be the “Second Dose Month” and please take up your appointment when it’s your turn. And at the same time as we push forwards with our programme to offer a vaccination to all adults by the end of July we’re building up our own long-term UK manufacturing capabilities. I’ve already told you that Novavax – a potentially significant new weapon in our armoury against Covid - is going to be made at Fujifilm in the North East. And I can today announce that the Vaccine Task Force has reached an agreement with GlaxoSmithKline to finish and bottle this precious fluid also in the North East giving us between 50 and 60 million doses of UK made vaccine subject to the right approvals from the MHRA. And then, of course, there is one other way we can all build our own individual defences against Covid and enjoy ourselves at the same time – and that is to take more exercise. So I am personally thrilled that I will be able to play tennis for instance And without being remotely preachy I do hope that we can take advantage of this moment and the beautiful weather – to play sport, to take exercise, to have fun and build our national resilience in that way too. And remember that outdoors is generally much safer than indoors and the way to continue on our cautious but irreversible roadmap to freedom is to follow the rules and remember hands, face, space and fresh air."
"Boris Johnson","COP26 Climate and Development Ministerial 2021: Foreign Secretary's opening remarks","31 March 2021","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/cop26-climate-and-development-ministerial-2020-foreign-secretarys-opening-remarks","Ministers, ladies and gentlemen, can I just offer a very warm welcome, particularly to those that weren’t at the group earlier today, to the Climate and Development Ministerial. I’m pleased to have you with us today and that we could get together I think this meeting is an important milestone on the road to COP26 in November. We’re running out of time to keep the 1.5 degree target within our grasp and the need to adapt is becoming, I think, more and more urgent. On top of this, we’ve got the challenge of recovering from COVID, a public health but also an economic challenge. We know budgets are severely drained. The debt burden, particularly in the developing world is growing. So we need to take action. We all know about the nature and the scale of the challenges that climate change poses. And today, instead of just talking about the problems, we want to focus on the action we are going to take to solve them. We want to focus on what we need to do to enable ambitious climate change action. So today is about hearing from those countries that are most vulnerable to climate change – those on the front line, if you like, of this struggle. We need to identify the support that you need. We need to consider where international systems can do more to deliver urgent climate action. So those here today – Foreign, Development, Planning, Finance Ministers from around the world – you’ve been invited to help identify the practical next steps and set the agenda for making progress in the lead up to COP26 in November. As well as some of the most vulnerable countries, whose voice we need to hear, we’ve also got donor countries and international organisations here today, so I’m really looking forward to the discussion. Now clearly there is a huge amount of excellent work already underway, particularly on adaption and resilience. In the UK we are committed to doing all that we can to support that important work. The Global Commission on Adaptation has found that 24 hours of warning of a coming storm or heatwave can cut the damage by 30%, which is massive if you think about what that means for those who would otherwise be affected. So the UK is supporting programmes to provide better weather forecasting and climate modelling to support vulnerable countries to take the early action that can save those lives. We also working to support smallholder farmers, who are on the frontline of climate change. They farm some of the most vulnerable landscapes, like hillsides, river deltas and flood plains. The very resources that they rely on to grow their crops and tend their animals are under threat from climate change. Through our contribution to the Adaptation for Smallholder Agriculture Programme, we are helping 6 million smallholder farmers in over 40 countries to increase their yields, to access commercial supply chains, and to ultimately increase their incomes and better their livelihoods. All this while, we’re also helping them to adapt to the impacts of climate change. Those are just a couple of examples of the practical work that is being done, the practical work that we want to support. And I think there is an urgent need to accelerate those efforts, and build on the 2019 Call for Action on Adaptation and Resilience, converting political promises into tangible delivery on the ground. That’s why my Prime Minister Boris Johnson launched the Adaptation Action Coalition back in January, together with our friends in Egypt, Bangladesh, Malawi, the Netherlands and St Lucia. I hope we will be discussing many more practical, real world projects and initiatives today, like that – and asking where you think more needs to be done. Let me just turn now to climate finance – which is another key part of our agenda today. We know that the lack of finance creates barriers to countries implementing the Paris Agreement. Combined with the challenge of recovering from the pandemic, this obviously risks setting back progress. And I think these issues are very clearly intertwined – so we need to tackle them together. And I think the way forward must be to engineer a green recovery that delivers both for people of this planet but also for the ecosystems. And the good news is that the economics of the transition to net zero emissions have transformed since the Paris Agreement was struck back in 2015. For example, for most of the world, renewables, like solar and wind power, already undercut fossil fuels as the cheapest and most secure form of energy. And the energy sector is a good example of where there’s a real opportunity here. By boosting investment in renewable energy, we could see the number of jobs in the sector quadruple, to reach 42 million globally by 2050. Off-grid solar power alone supports over 350,000 jobs across the East, West and Central parts of Africa, and South Asia, with the potential to increase to 1.3 million in the next two years. So there’s an opportunity to make the green recovery about job creation, not an economic drain or burden. Seizing such opportunities and getting the recovery right for the long term, will depend on improving access to climate finance – and the quality, as well as the quantity, of that finance that’s made available. Again, here in the UK we’re doing our bit, we’re responding. We have committed £11.6 billion over the next five years in climate finance. And, through our Presidencies of COP26 but also the G7, we are urging others to try and follow the example we set and galvanise that international action that’s so necessary to tackle this challenge. We’re working closely with our G7 partners, with the G20 and with the Paris Club partners to agree an unprecedented response to alleviate the debt burden that has grown because of the pandemic. The G20 scheme which we helped launch last year has suspended repayments from the most vulnerable countries worth $5.7 billion. I know that many of the other countries joining us today are making tremendous contributions to tackling these issues. So I hope we will also hear more about that today – and about a whole range of other ambitious actions in the months ahead. Again, we want to hear from those who need access to finance – what are your priorities in these different areas? So this meeting is an opportunity to highlight the areas where more action is needed and how we drive that forward. I think it’s also a chance to point the way to the outcomes that we want at the end of COP26. And it’s a moment to focus on the practical solutions that we all want to see. So let’s get on with it. Thank you. Read the press release on the international Climate and Development Ministerial event."
"Boris Johnson","PM statement at coronavirus press conference: 5 April 2021","5 April 2021","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-statement-at-coronavirus-press-conference-5-april-2021","Good afternoon, I hope you’re all continuing to enjoy the Easter break, and I know that over this weekend millions of people have been able to see loved ones for the first time in months. And I want to thank you all again for your patience, because it is really clear now that this is paying off. And it your collective efforts, our collective efforts, that has given us that crucial time and space to vaccinate more than 31 million people. And I’m pleased that we’ve also been able to support our overseas territories so that Gibraltar has become one of the first places in the world to offer a vaccination to its entire adult population. And the net result of your efforts and the vaccine roll-out is that I can today confirm that from Monday 12th April, we will move to Step Two of our roadmap - re-opening shops, gyms, zoos, holiday campsites, personal care services like hairdressers and, of course, beer gardens and outdoor hospitality of all kinds. And on Monday the 12th I will be going to the pub myself - and cautiously but irreversibly raising a pint of beer to my lips. We’re also increasing the number of visitors to care homes from one to two – to allow residents to see more of their loved ones. We think that these changes are fully justified by the data which show we are meeting our four tests for easing the lockdown as Chris will shortly explain. But – and you know I’m going to say this – we can’t be complacent. We can see the waves of sickness afflicting other countries and we’ve seen how this story goes. We still don’t know how strong the vaccine shield will be when cases begin to rise, as I’m afraid that they will – and that’s why we’re saying: Please get your vaccine or your second dose when your turn comes. And please use the free NHS tests – even if you don’t feel ill, because remember 1 in 3 people with this virus doesn’t have any symptoms - and you can get these tests from pharmacies or your local test site, you can even order them on gov.uk and get home deliveries. As part of our roadmap we’re also publishing today on gov.uk the early thinking on our four reviews, on the safe return of major events, on social distancing, the potential role of Covid status certification, and on the resumption of international travel. We set out our roadmap and we’re sticking to it. And I want to stress, that we see nothing in the present data that makes us think that we will have to deviate from that roadmap. But it is by being cautious, by monitoring the data at every stage and by following the rules: remembering hands, face, space and fresh air - that we hope together to make this roadmap to freedom irreversible."
"Boris Johnson","Navigating global challenges: speech by Laura Clarke","8 April 2021","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/navigating-global-challenges-speech-by-laura-clarke","E ngā mana, e ngā reo, e ngā iwi, e rau rangatira mā, tēnā koutou, tēnā koutou, tēnā koutou katoa. Mālō e lelei. A very good evening everybody and a big thank you to NZIIA and IPANZ for convening us this evening. This is billed as a speech on foreign policy and global challenges, but I would like to start, if I can, with a bit of a mihi to Auckland and all Aucklanders, for hosting such a fabulous Americas Cup. And a huge congratulations also of course to Team New Zealand and New Zealand as a whole for its success in defending the Cup. I was lucky enough to go out on the water a number of times and I just loved the atmosphere out on the water. I loved the – normally friendly – rivalry and banter between the teams and their supporters, and particularly, of course, the rivalry between the UK and New Zealand. And I’m completely delighted that the UK has been confirmed as the official challenger, and that the race might – just might – return to the Isle of Wight, where it first started with Queen Victoria in the audience. And of course all these years later, we still live in hope that the UK might at one point win the America’s Cup, something that has eluded us to date. The America’s Cup, in all its modern technological glory, is the latest iteration of the great sailing and seafaring traditions in both our countries, and in the Pacific region as a whole. Our ancestors and tipuna navigated these oceans, these moana, with enormous bravery, skill and teamwork - contending with mad storms and seas, with often hostile forces - but fixing on the Southern Cross, at least in this part of the world, and navigating their way through. And it occurred to me that the critical ingredients of success in sailing, and navigating our oceans, are not dissimilar to those that we need to navigate global challenges. So take the success of the America’s Cup. There are, I would say, four main ingredients: First, you need to understand the elements: the conditions in which you are trying to navigate. The prevailing wind, the currents, the sudden changes of weather, the intent, capability and tactics of your competitors and rivals. Second, you need a plan: you need to be 100% focused on what you’re trying to achieve, and where you’re trying to get to. Thirdly, you need the right capability: the right technology, the right boat – and of course the right investment in that technology – and the right skills. And fourthly, finally, you need the right team: you need the right relationships, both on the boat, and beyond. I think that those four ingredients of America’s Cup success can also be applied to how we navigate the global challenges of our age. So if you’ll humour me, I’ll structure my comments into two main sections: Firstly, I’ll talk about the elements in which we find ourselves: what are the prevailing winds, what are the storms coming at us across the horizon, what are the threats to our security and way of life? And then secondly, I’ll talk about our plan of how we’re navigating the seas in which we find ourselves: what our priorities are over the next ten years, and the sort of actor the UK aspires to be on the world stage. And as I talk about our plan I will also talk about what that means in terms of: our tools and capability our relationships And with a particular focus on where the UK-NZ relationship is in all this, how we are working together Understanding the elements So first: to understand the elements. My generation grew up in an era of almost unprecedented peace, prosperity and progress. It wasn’t quite the End of History – but there was a sense of inexorable progress: in tackling poverty and all kinds of inequality, in preventing large-scale conflict, in democratisation and respect for human rights. Take for example our progress in poverty reduction: the World Bank tells us that back in 1981 44% of people were living in extreme poverty, but by 2019 that had fallen to 8.23%. That is, by any measure, an extraordinary achievement. Of course there was still plenty to keep us worried (terrorism, climate change, conflict), and I’m not looking back with rose tinted glasses. But the overall sense was that liberal democracies had won the battle of ideologies and that countries could work together – imperfectly – to address the challenges facing the world. I think there was also a sense here, at least until a decade or so back, that New Zealand was, by virtue of perhaps size, geographic location and perhaps policy settings, more or less protected from many of the dangers facing the rest of the world. And – for all of us – there was a clear distinction between the domestic and the foreign. I’m not sure that any of that is true today. Progress is not linear, the challenges facing us are increasingly transnational, respecting neither borders nor distance, and our domestic security and resilience can’t be separated from what happens overseas. So it’s in that changing context that the UK has just mapped out the big challenges facing the UK, and the world, over the next 10 years. It paints a complex, dangerous and rather daunting picture, with implications for all of us – whether we are in London, Auckland, or somewhere in between – in terms of our security, prosperity, and way of life. And I’m going to summarise those challenges as follows: Firstly, there is an increasing competition between states over interests, norms and values. Authoritarian states and malign actors are seeking to undermine the democratic systems and openness that underpin our way of life. We see that democracy can retreat just as easily as it advances. In this decade the combined GDP of autocratic regimes is expected to exceed the combined GDP of democracies. Now that has implications far beyond the domestic, or the freedoms of those living in each system. Authoritarian regimes are more likely to house or sponsor terrorists, to go to war, to commit mass human rights abuses, trigger large scale flows of immigration, or interfere in other countries democratic processes. They are more likely to breach international norms. Consider, for example, the use of chemical weapons in Kuala Lumpur airport; on a flight from Tomsk to Moscow; on a street in Salisbury; or in a residential neighbourhood in Syria. All breach the long-held norms on the use of chemical weapons. Authoritarian regimes are also far less likely to want to engage multilaterally, and in good faith, to solve the world’s problems. So the international order which has served us well – if imperfectly – to date is under great pressure. And why should we care enough to make a stand on this? Because British people expect their government to stand up for freedom, democracy and the rule of law – both at home and overseas. It’s in our DNA, and I think it is in New Zealand’s DNA too. The flouting of international norms challenges the freedom and safety that we each hold dear. The second challenge is the overwhelming array of global challenges facing us right now. The existential challenge that is climate change – threatening the very existence of Pacific Island states in this neighbourhood, and playing havoc with our weather systems. The crisis in biodiversity: and if you haven’t watched David Attenborough’s A Life on Our Planet, I encourage you to do so. Pandemics, organised crime, terrorism. The list goes on. These are challenges that don’t respect national borders, that have a direct, local impact on us as individuals, and can only be solved by countries working together. The third set of challenges is what I would describe is the as yet unregulated wild west that is space, and cyber space, and the rapid technological change which brings both opportunities and threats. The blurring, for example, of the boundary between war and peace. Let me pause on that one. We all know what war looks like when one country’s troops cross a border, and invade the sovereign territory of another. But if a country or even a non-state actor conducts a cyber operation that brings down another country’s financial system, or health system – is that war? States and non-state actors everywhere are grappling with these challenges – how to protect themselves from threats, how to use them to their advantage – and it is our assessment that science and technology will be a driver of competitive and strategic advantage in the world, whether through AI, quantum tech, or engineering biology. The fourth set of challenges is the geopolitical and geoeconomic shifts: the growing importance of the Indo-Pacific to global prosperity and security, and China as a systemic competitor. We assess that China’s increasing power and assertiveness internationally is likely to be the most significant geopolitical factor of the 2020s. And all this, of course, in the time of Covid, which still has a long way to play out- and adds further complexity to the challenges facing our world. Part Two: The plan So it’s all a lot to take in, and navigate – and the temptation of course is to say it’s all too difficult. Not to venture out in the dangerous oceans, but to keep our boats, our waka, safe on the shore. To hunker down, and look after our own. But looking after our own – whether it’s my Mum in rural Essex, or my in-laws here in Parnell in Auckland – means engaging internationally. Resilience begins abroad, and our day to day lives are impacted – whether it’s Covid or the Ever Given adding to already disrupted global supply chains, spiking shipping prices and hurting export profits; whether it’s the health and economic impacts of Covid; the increase in online extremism; the drugs sold to young people on our streets; cyber attacks on local government: local problems often have global roots. So we have to dock out, and begin to navigate these stormy seas – to protect our way of life, our freedoms, our prosperity and to keep ourselves and our friends safe. That’s of course when you need a plan, a Southern Cross, to help navigate these global challenges. And that is where the UK Government’s Integrated Review comes in. It sets out - in the context of global disruption and competition – the Johnson Government’s vision for the UK on the world stage, following our exit from the European Union, and how we’re going to navigate the waves ahead. It comes in what is a big and no doubt testing year of leadership for the UK in the world, as we take on the Presidency of the G7, and host COP26, the big climate change conference in partnership with Italy, and as we host the Global Education Summit in partnership with Kenya. It’s also of course a big year for New Zealand as the host of APEC. So what can you expect from the UK? Well as the good High Commissioner that I am, I’m going to quote my boss, the Foreign Secretary, who said that our concept of Global Britain is, to be “a creative disrupter willing and able to challenge the status quo but in the cause of good order and future stability. A mould breaker, but also a rule-maker and one which strives and yearns to build bridges”. So, what is “our plan” to achieve that? The Review focuses on five broad priority areas for the UK over the coming 10 years. And I would like – if you’ll permit me – to go through each five. First, it’s about solving global challenges The UK wants be a burden-sharing nation, bringing our strengths and global reach to play, and working multilaterally to solve global challenges. I’m going to give two examples: climate and COVID. Tackling climate change and biodiversity loss is our top international priority, and that’s set out very clearly in the Integrated Review. At home we have committed to reaching net zero by 2050, and to do that we have to reduce our emissions by 68% by 2030, which is no small task. Internationally, we are hosting COP26, in partnership with Italy, we’re working to drive up global ambition to address this existential threat. And we have committed £11.6 billion to international climate finance to help other countries mitigate and adapt to climate change. We are also clear that all our Overseas Development Assistance needs to be delivered in line with our Paris Agreement commitments. We know that New Zealand shares our analysis of the scale of the problem, and shares our ambition to deal with it – and is already providing leadership. New Zealand is the first country in the world to implement mandatory climate risk reporting in line with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures’ recommendations. You are growing innovative industries such as agritech to help reduce emissions, and you spending millions more on foreign aid for climate change, supporting the wider-Pacific neighbourhood. UK – New Zealand collaboration in this space is crucial – both bilaterally, in the region, and in raising ambition globally to meet Paris agreement commitments. Secondly: COVID, or rather, strengthening our global health. Of course the immediate task is helping the world to beat Covid-19 by accelerating equitable access to vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics worldwide. The UK has driven a collective international response to increase global access to vaccines through a mechanism called COVAX. We have committed up to £548 million to help provide up to 92 developing countries with more than one billion doses of the vaccine in 2021 – including here in the Pacific. We were the biggest funder until recently when – thankfully – the Biden Administration got involved. The development and rollout of a vaccine, in unprecedented speed and time, is a victory for investment in research and development, and for international collaboration – whether on the science, the logistics, or the funding. But we can’t rest there. We need to be better prepared for future pandemics and disease. So we are using our G7 Presidency to drive international action; we are increasing our funding to the World Health Organization by 30% - over £340m over four years; and crucially, we are using our Overseas Development Assistance to support more resilient populations in developing countries through transformative global health investment. Our Foreign Secretary, Dominic Raab, has just been in Indonesia talking with the Government there about using our G7 Presidency and their G20 Presidency next year so that the world is better prepared for the next pandemic. Because no one is safe until we are all safe. Acting as a force for good in the world The second theme, and very much linked to global challenges, is the UK’s desire to act as a force for good in the world and – through our actions – demonstrate that a fairer, just, open world is also a safer and more prosperous one. We aim to defend democracy and human rights, support the vulnerable, and uphold the values that we – in the UK and New Zealand – hold dear. Just as is the case here in New Zealand, our values run through our diplomacy. In the past few years we have – for example – introduced a new system of autonomous ‘Magnitsky’ sanctions to target human rights abusers around the world. When China imposed a regressive national security law on Hong Kong, we offered British Nationals (Overseas) the right to live and work in the UK. We have introduced a package of modern slavery measures to ensure that British organisations are neither complicit in nor profiting from the human rights violations, including those happening in Xinjiang. I note that the question of modern slavery is a live topic here in New Zealand. We have championed media freedom, through the Media Freedom Coalition of 46 countries which together advocates for the safety of journalists and media workers at home and abroad, recognising that media freedom is a critical underpinning of proper functioning democracies. So I am delighted that Foreign Minister Nanaia Mahuta announced at the end of March that New Zealand has now joined that coalition. We are also working to tackle poverty, and late last year we appointed our first Special Envoy for Famine Prevention and Humanitarian Affairs, pledging £180 million to tackle food insecurity. Looking ahead, we are working through our new merged Foreign, Commonwealth, and Development Office – which brings together our diplomatic and development heft – to ensure that we have the greatest possible impact on priority issues. We will spend £10billion this year on poverty reduction, education, humanitarian assistance, gender equality, good governance, and freedom of religion and belief. And we are using our global networks – from the Commonwealth to our COP Presidency - to raise awareness of the issues facing Small Island Developing States – for example access to climate finance for South Pacific States. Trade The third topic is trade, and we will champion the free flow of trade, capital and knowledge as the best way to drive economic growth, and the recovery from Covid. And in many ways the UK’s post-Brexit independent trade policy is starting right here, in New Zealand, as we are negotiating our first post-Brexit FTA with New Zealand, and of course with Australia and the US. That bilateral free trade agreement, which is about to enter its fourth round of negotiations, is part of our plan to have trade agreements with countries covering 80% of UK trade by the end of 2022. The FTA should also form the foundation for a strategic UK-NZ partnership on global trade issues. We are looking, for example, to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), of which NZ is the depository state. We want to work with New Zealand on reform of the global trade system, to ensure that it works fairly for everyone. And we want to combine the UK’s scale and global heft – as the sixth largest economy, and member of the G7 – with New Zealand’s track record in innovating in trade policy. Right now for example we’re particularly interested in the NZ-led Agreement on Climate Change, Trade and Sustainability, which seeks to use trade to advance our shared objectives on environmental protection. Trade is about more than creating wealth. Our security and our prosperity are mutually reinforcing. And trade can be a driver for positive change. We see trade as a global good, and not just in economic terms: it also enhances bilateral relations and ensures a level of co-operation and interdependence that reduces the risk of conflict. It can reduce inequality. And the link to our domestic resilience and security is strong: whether that’s about diversifying trade partners to avoid over-reliance on a particular partner or vulnerability; or ensuring resilient supply chains, or open shipping routes. Science and Technology Fourthly, we’re focused on investing in science and technology and acting as a responsible cyber power. The rapid pace of change in science and technology is transforming many aspects of our lives, fundamentally reshaping our economy and society and unlocking previously inconceivable improvements, such as in global health and prosperity. It is also therefore an area of competition, and we have to make sure that the ethics and standards around the use of technology keep pace with the speed of change, and align with our values. Maurice Wilkins in genetics and Ernest Rutherford in physics were two Kiwi Nobel prize winners who won their prizes for work undertaken in the UK. So we have a great legacy of science collaboration, and there’s a lot that we’re doing in this space. Take Space, for example. It has become fundamental to our way of life. We rely on space for our sat nav, predicting our weather, our critical national infrastructure – and in New Zealand, supporting Search and Rescue Operations as far afield as the Ross Sea. Yet Space is becoming increasingly congested and contested. So the UK, working closely with New Zealand and other partners, last year initiated a UN process to establish what constitutes responsible behaviour in space. The UN Secretary General will issue a report later this year. So we will be investing in our national science and technology capability and strengthening our international partnerships to stay at the forefront of new technologies and help us shape international rules on technology, cyber, digital and data that protect freedom and security. And we’ve given that work the rather exciting term of “Regulatory Diplomacy”. What Regulatory Diplomacy is, is about how you shape the norms, how you uphold standards, and drive for better regulation. Regulation that enables us to embrace and harness the technologies of the future. We are doing this Regulatory Diplomacy by prioritising engagement with International Organisations and bilateral discussions to influence decisions around regulations, standards setting, and norms. The Prime Minister’s ambition for 2030 articulates this: he wants to have the UK “at the forefront of shaping the global debate on cyber, tech, digital, and data”, and he wants us to be “at the heart of a network of allied states committed to upholding global norms and human rights”. And in peer-reviewing the UK’s approach to International Regulatory Cooperation with the OECD, both Canada and New Zealand remarked on the innovative and proactive approach we are taking to this. Security and Deterrence My fifth, final, topic is security and deterrence. We need a more robust approach to security and deterrence. To be a “force” for good globally, we and our friends must be secure and resilient at home. We use the word “force” – because without power, economic, military, diplomatic, cultural clout, we can’t do anything. Because those who do not share our values, and those who might do us harm are increasingly powerful and assertive and willing to flout international rules. So that is why we are increasing our investment in defence to 2.2% of GDP, with over £24 billion to reform and renew our Armed Forces, including at least £6.6 billion for next generation capabilities and research, especially in cyber and space. And we are prepared to take risks and make difficult decisions to further strengthen the UK’s strategic technological advantage. Shipbuilding investment will double over the life of this Parliament to more than £1.7bn a year, and over £1 billion over the next decade in new autonomous Mine-Hunting Capability, with equally ambitious plans in air and land forces. We are also reaffirming our commitment to NATO and supporting its adaptation to new threats. NATO is a bedrock of European security, a group of democracies working together in an alliance, which is unique and powerful in both its military capability, but also its values, voice and influence. We are committed to strengthening global arms control disarmament and counter-proliferation. And we’re committed to ensuring that we can protect ourselves and our Allies by the continued operation of a minimum, credible, independent nuclear deterrent based on a continuous at sea deterrence. And that includes increasing the limit of our overall stockpile to no more than 269 warheads. Now I want to pause for a moment on the UK’s nuclear policy. Because the UK and NZ have a theological difference on nuclear, a longstanding difference on nuclear, and some argue that the announcement that we are lifting the ceiling on the number of war heads is inconsistent with our commitment to global disarmament and counter-proliferation. But I want to be clear that the UK remains fully committed to the long-term goal of a world without nuclear weapons, we all want to live in a world without nuclear weapons. And we’re fully committed to the full implementation of the Treaty on the Non- Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. But disarmament needs to be multilateral, not unilateral. And the threats facing the UK and our allies are increasing in scale and complexity, with nuclear-armed states ignoring international norms of behaviour. So we believe that the best way to protect ourselves and our allies is to maintain a credible nuclear deterrent. Cyber I want to talk now a bit about cyber. In a more contested world, remaining simultaneously open and secure requires a more robust position on security and resilience. The changing nature of threats facing the UK, be it state threats, cyber attacks or terrorism, require a response that goes well beyond the traditional view of defence. I would like to highlight the inexorable rise of malicious cyber attacks on the last decade as one example of the rapidly shifting nature of trans-national threats. The UK and NZ collaborate extensively on cyber threats and mitigations. As you will expect, much of that collaboration is undertaken behind very closed and secure doors, but we have joined together publicly to call out and attribute cyber attacks carried out by state actors. For example, the instance of malicious cyber incidents attributed by the GCSB to the Russian Government in 2018, were called out in tandem with the UK. That the UK is a responsible cyber power is referenced throughout the Integrated Review. We are committed to a progressive and proactive approach to shaping the future frameworks that govern cyberspace, upholding existing rules and building consensus on positive norms of behaviour. But as the third most powerful cyber nation, according to Harvard University’s National Cyber Power Index, we are also strengthening our policies to protect the UK in cyberspace, address cyber attacks and protect critical national infrastructure. A tangible outcome of this new approach to UK security is the creation of the National Cyber Force (NCF) which began operations in April last year. The NCF is a defence and intelligence partnership that conducts legal, and ethical cyber operations to disrupt state threats, terrorism, and organised crime in support of the UK’s national security priorities. I’ll give you some examples of the NCF operations to date: Interfering with a mobile phone to prevent a terrorist being able to communicate with their contacts; helping to prevent cyberspace from being used as a global platform for serious crimes, including sexual abuse of children and fraud; keeping UK aircraft safe from targeting by hostile weapons systems; training and recruiting at scale, to help fulfil the UK’s cyber skills aspirations; and investing in the research and development required to establish and maintain world leading cyber capabilities. UK and New Zealand in the Indo Pacific I’ve been talking big picture about the world and its challenges. And I want now if I can, to zoom in - at least a bit - to talk about the Indo-Pacific. Because all of the threats, challenges and opportunities that I have been talking about this evening are playing out in this region, in the Indo-Pacific. The Indo-Pacific is home to half the world’s population, 40% of global GDP, 6 members of the G20, 17.5% of the UK’s global trade. It is also of course the scene for intense geopolitical competition, trade co-operation and competition, as well as a range of choke points for international shipping routes, climate and biodiversity impacts, poverty, challenges to democracy and human rights, rapid technological change - it’s all happening in this part of the world. And that is why the UK is increasing its engagement in the region, strengthening relationships from India to the South Pacific; bringing our economic and military heft and global reach to bear, and increasing co-operation on shared priorities. New Zealand is a key partner in this ‘Indo-Pacific tilt’. Whether that’s supporting our application for ASEAN Dialogue Partner status; as depository state for the CPTPP; supporting our increased engagement in the South Pacific, where we have doubled our diplomatic presence in the last couple of years and are co-located with New Zealand in three out of our six High Commissions in the South Pacific. Defence is an essential part of the UK’s integrated offer to the Indo-Pacific region and we will work with partners to build resilience and capacity, tackle shared security challenges and uphold freedom of navigation and international law. The deployment of HMS Queen Elizabeth, leading the Carrier Strike Group, joined by several international partners later this year, underlines the UK’s global ambition and leadership as an inclusive, outward-facing and free-trading nation, assertive in defending our values and interests and a champion of international rules. This high profile naval deployment marks a significant focus for this year, but with more to follow as we sustain our engagement. Offshore patrol vessels will remain in the region providing a greater maritime presence, and we will increase our capacity building and training with key allies and partners and expand our Defence Attache network by a third. And we will provide a bigger and more consistent contribution to the Five Power Defence Arrangements. We will work closely together with other like-minded countries in responding to the systemic challenge that China poses to our security, prosperity and values, while also co-operating on shared priorities such as trade and climate change. And we will work closely with the US which, under the leadership of President Biden, is showing positive leadership in the world, and in this region: whether on climate change, global health policy, or security. Closing: 2021 as the year of UK leadership. So, to conclude, 2020 was – frankly – a pretty terrible year for pretty much everyone. And I strongly suspect that 2021 will be no less challenging: we have no idea how long this pandemic will last, and I think that we need to guard strongly against optimism bias that we’re on the way out. And as I have articulated at length this evening, we have no shortage of things to worry about. But for the UK, after four years of EU transition, and after a terrible Covid year last year, it feels like we have entered the exciting stage of what next. Our vaccine rollout is going really well at home, with 47.5% of people having had at least one dose, and we are driving work on global vaccine provision. Our trade negotiations are underway, our Pacific Posts are up and running, and we are charting the new normal. And for those who feared that Brexit meant that the UK was turning inwards, I hope it’s clear that the opposite is the case. Our Prime Minister speaks of the UK being a ‘problem-solving, burden-sharing nation with a global perspective’, and we will bring that to bear this year, with leadership of the G7, with a focus on prosperity, health, sustainability, and open societies. And with our Presidency of COP26, in partnership with Italy. There are synergies, too, with New Zealand’s APEC Presidency, and we are committed to working together to drive progress on the issues that matter. Ladies and gentlemen, the UK and New Zealand are on opposite sides of the world. We are oceans apart. But ours is a friendship built on shared history, shared values, a shared analysis of the world and its threats, and a shared vision for the future. We don’t always agree on the prescription – and that’s the value of different perspectives – but we are committed to working together, both bilaterally and multilaterally, to tackle global challenges, and promote global goods. At all critical times in our history we have relied on our friends. In two world wars, during the cold war, as founding partners of the UN back in 1945, in conflicts in the Middle East and beyond, we have worked as one team, sharing expertise, experience, people. That relationship as important as ever: in responding to the pandemic; in our trade partnership and shared prosperity; in defending our security; in upholding democracy and human rights; and in navigating the shifting geopolitical currents – both in the Indo-Pacific, and beyond. We are all in this together. He waka eke noa. So here’s to navigating these moana together. And to the UK one day – finally – winning the Americas cup. Tēnā koutou, tēnā koutou, tēnā tatau katoa."
"Boris Johnson","Prime Minister's statement on the death of His Royal Highness The Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh","9 April 2021","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-statement-on-the-death-of-his-royal-highness-the-prince-philip-duke-of-edinburgh","Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s statement on the death of HRH The Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh It was with great sadness that a short time ago I received word from Buckingham Palace that His Royal Highness The Duke of Edinburgh has passed away at the age of 99. Prince Philip earned the affection of generations here in the United Kingdom, across the Commonwealth and around the world. He was the longest serving consort in history, one of the last surviving people in this country to have served in the second world war at Cape Matapan, where he was mentioned in despatches for bravery and in the invasion of Sicily, where he saved his ship by his quick thinking and from that conflict he took an ethic of service that he applied throughout the unprecedented changes of the post war era. Like the expert carriage driver that he was he helped to steer the royal family and the monarchy so that it remains an institution indisputably vital to the balance and happiness of our national life. He was an environmentalist, and a champion of the natural world long before it was fashionable. With his Duke of Edinburgh awards scheme he shaped and inspired the lives of countless young people and at literally tens of thousands of events he fostered their hopes and encouraged their ambitions. We remember the Duke for all of this and above all for his steadfast support for Her Majesty The Queen. Not just as her consort, by her side every day of her reign, but as her husband, her “strength and stay”, of more than 70 years. And it is to Her Majesty, and her family, that our nation’s thoughts must turn today. Because they have lost not just a much-loved and highly respected public figure, but a devoted husband and a proud and loving father, grandfather and, in recent years, great-grandfather. Speaking on their golden wedding anniversary, Her Majesty said that our country owed her husband “a greater debt than he would ever claim or we shall ever know” and I am sure that estimate is correct. So we mourn today with Her Majesty The Queen we offer our condolences to her and to all her family and we give thanks, as a nation and a Kingdom, for the extraordinary life and work of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh."
"Boris Johnson","The Prime Minister's tribute to His Royal Highness The Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh: 12 April 2021","12 April 2021","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/the-prime-ministers-tribute-to-his-royal-highness-the-prince-philip-duke-of-edinburgh-12-april-2021","Mr Speaker, I beg to move: That an Humble Address be presented to Her Majesty expressing the deepest sympathies of this House on the death of His Royal Highness The Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, and the heartfelt thanks of this House and this nation for his unfailing dedication to this Country and the Commonwealth, exemplified in his distinguished service in the Royal Navy in the Second World War; his commitment to young people in setting up The Duke of Edinburgh’s Award, a scheme which has touched the lives of millions across the globe; his early, passionate commitment to the environment; and his unstinting support to Your Majesty throughout his life. Mr Speaker, it is fitting that on Saturday His Royal Highness the Duke of Edinburgh will be conveyed to his final resting place in a Land Rover, which Prince Philip had designed himself, with a long wheel base and a capacious rear cabin, because that vehicle’s unique and idiosyncratic silhouette reminds the world that he was above all a practical man, who could take something very traditional – whether a machine or indeed a great national institution – and find a way by his own ingenuity to improve it, to adapt it for the 20th or the 21st century. That gift for innovation was apparent from his earliest career in the Navy. When he served in the second world war, he was mentioned in despatches for his “alertness and appreciation of the situation” during the Battle of Cape Matapan, and he played a crucial role in helping to sink two enemy cruisers. But it was later, during the invasion of Sicily, that he was especially remembered by his crewmates for what he did to save their own ship. In a moment of high danger, at night, when HMS Wallace was vulnerable to being blown up by enemy planes, he improvised a floating decoy – complete with fires to make it look like a stricken British vessel – so that the Wallace was able to slip away, and the enemy took out the decoy. He was there at Tokyo Bay in 1945, barely 200 yards away from the Japanese surrender on the deck of USS Missouri; but he wasn’t content just to watch history through his binoculars. It seems that he used the lull to get on with repainting the hull of HMS Whelp; and throughout his life – a life that was by necessity wrapped from such a young age in symbol and ceremony – one can see that same instinct, to look for what was most useful, and most practical, and for what would take things forward. He was one of the first people in this country to use a mobile phone. In the 1970s, he was driving an electric taxi on the streets of London – the fore-runner of the modern low-carbon fleet, and, again, a vehicle of his own specifications. He wasn’t content just to be a carriage driver. He played a large part in pioneering and codifying the sport of competitive carriage driving. And if it is true that carriage-driving is not a mass-participation sport – not yet – he had other novel ideas that touched the lives of millions, developed their character and confidence, their teamwork and self-reliance. It was amazing and instructive, to listen on Friday to the Cabinet’s tributes to the Duke, and to hear how many were proud to say that they, or their children, had benefited from taking part in his Duke of Edinburgh Award schemes. I will leave it to the House to speculate as to who claimed to have got a gold award, and who got a bronze. But I believe those ministers spoke for millions of people – across this country and around the world – who felt that the Duke had in some way touched their lives, people whose work he supported in the course of an astonishing 22,219 public engagements, people he encouraged, and, yes, he amused. It is true that he occasionally drove a coach and horses through the finer points of diplomatic protocol, and he coined a new word – dontopedalogy – for the experience of putting your foot in your mouth. And it is also true that among his more parliamentary expressions he commented adversely on the French concept of breakfast, and told a British student in Papua New Guinea that he was lucky not to be eaten, and that the people of the Cayman Islands were descended from pirates, and that he would like to go to Russia except that, as he put it, “the bastards murdered half my family”. But the world did not hold it against him, Mr Speaker. On the contrary, they overwhelmingly understood that he was trying to break the ice, to get things moving, to get people laughing and forget their nerves; and to this day there is a community in the Pacific islands that venerates Prince Philip as a god, or volcano spirit – a conviction that was actually strengthened when a group came to London to have tea with him in person. When he spoke so feelingly about the problems of overpopulation, and humanity’s relentless incursion on the natural world, and the consequent destruction of habitat and species, he contrived to be at once politically incorrect and also ahead of his time. In a quite unparalleled career of advice and encouragement and support, he provided one particular service that I believe the House will know in our hearts was the very greatest of all. In the constant love he gave to Her Majesty the Queen – as her liege man of life and limb, in the words he spoke at the Coronation – he sustained her throughout this extraordinary second Elizabethan age, now the longest reign of any monarch in our history. It was typical of him that in wooing Her Majesty – famously not short of a jewel or two – he offered jewellery of his own design. He dispensed with the footmen in powdered wigs. He introduced television cameras, and at family picnics in Balmoral he would barbecue the sausages on a large metal contraption that all Prime Ministers must have goggled at for decades, complete with rotisserie and compartments for the sauces, that was – once again, Mr Speaker - a product of his own invention and creation. Indeed as an advocate of skills and craft and science and technology this country has had no royal champion to match him since Prince Albert, and I know that in due course the House and the country will want to consider a suitable memorial to Prince Philip. It is with that same spirit of innovation that as co-gerent of the Royal Family, he shaped and protected the monarchy, through all the vicissitudes of the last seven decades, and helped to modernise and continually to adapt an institution that is above politics, that incarnates our history, and that is indisputably vital to the balance and happiness of our national life. By his unstinting service to The Queen, the Commonwealth, the armed forces, the environment, to millions of people young and not so young around the world, and to countless other causes, he gave us and he gives us all a model of selflessness, and of putting others before ourselves. And though I expect Mr Speaker, he might be embarrassed or even exasperated to receive these tributes, he made this country a better place, and for that he will be remembered with gratitude and with fondness for generations to come."
"Boris Johnson","PM statement at coronavirus press conference: 20 April 2021","20 April 2021","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-statement-at-coronavirus-press-conference-20-april-2021","Thank you very much for joining us. I’m joined today by Dr Nikki Kanani. There is no doubt at all that this country is continuing to make progress in the fight against Covid. We are proceeding with our roadmap and I want to thank everybody for continuing to follow the guidance and to thank parents and families for the incredible work you are doing to help test pupils through the Easter holidays and to encourage you to keep testing them twice a week as schools return. And above all I want to thank everybody involved in the outstanding vaccine roll-out especially those of you coming forwards in huge numbers as you are. 19 out of 20 of those who’ve had a first dose are coming forward for a second meaning that almost 1 in 5 of all adults have now had a second dose. And on first jabs we’ve now vaccinated 33 million people including 60 per cent of the 45-49 year olds. And we know that this vaccination programme is making a big difference. We know that it’s helping to reduce suffering and save lives potentially on a very big scale. But we don’t yet know the full extent of the protection that we are building up the exact strength of our defences – and as we look at what is happening in other countries with cases now at record numbers around the world, we cannot delude ourselves that Covid has gone away. I see nothing in the data now that makes me think we are going to have to deviate in any way from the roadmap cautious but irreversible that we have set out. But the majority of scientific opinion in this country is still firmly of the view that there will be another wave of covid at some stage this year and so we must – as far as possible – learn to live with this disease, as we live with other diseases. We will be bolstering our defences with booster jabs this Autumn, we’ll be continuing with testing, and today I want to announce what we hope will be a further line of medical defence. The United Kingdom was the first country in the world to pioneer dexamethasone, which has saved a million lives globally. And today we are creating a new Antivirals Task Force to search for the most promising new medicines and support their development through clinical trials with the aim of making them safely and rapidly available as early as the Autumn. This means, for example, that if you test positive there might be a tablet you could take at home to stop the virus in its tracks and significantly reduce the chance of infection turning into more severe disease. Or if you’re living with someone who has tested positive, there might be a pill you could take for a few days to stop you getting the disease yourself. And by focussing on these antivirals we hope to lengthen the UK’s lead in life sciences and to give ever greater confidence to the people of this country that we can continue on our path towards freedom. We have a taken a big step again this month, reopening significant parts of our country again, and for many people this last week has brought the first glimmerings of a return to normality having a pint, having a haircut, making that trip to the shops. Every day science is helping us to get back towards normality and I believe that antiviral treatments can play an important part. And if we keep going, follow the rules remember hands, face, space, fresh air – then we can keep each other safe and see through our roadmap to reclaim our lives in full."
"Boris Johnson","Preparing for future pandemics","20 April 2021","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/preparing-for-future-pandemics","Thank you Sir Patrick – and good morning everyone. I think this is an incredibly important meeting and an incredibly important process and I’m very grateful to everyone for their time. It was Melinda Gates – who will close this conference tomorrow – who once said: Goals are only wishes, unless you have a plan. And so at the UN last September, the Prime Minister set out a plan: the Five Point Plan to Prevent Future Pandemics. At its heart is the drive to get better and quicker at developing and deploying what we might need in a future crisis, and especially the life-saving vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics. But not limited to those things. And as hard as it might be to focus on a future crisis while we’re still facing down COVID-19, the WHO estimates we face a pandemic threat every 5 years. So we must be better prepared. And we must start that process now. And if you think about it, the structures we’ve put in place, from the ACT-Accelerator to COVAX, we’re in a stronger place than we were and we’ve been stronger when we’ve worked in partnership. And there’s a couple of important points that I think are critical to what this partnership means. Firstly, I think it’s very important we recognise that whether it’s public or private, or from academia or industry, we must draw on expertise and resources wherever we find them, and we’re more than the sum of our parts. And that is at the core of what this Pandemic Preparedness Partnership is all about. And looking at the part that all of us can play in improving and streamlining vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics, so we’re better prepared for future pandemics. Let me turn for a moment to the role of the G7. And I can see Sir Patrick sitting in front of the G7 logo there. The UK as President of the G7 will be ensuring that we use that institution to drive forward the project that we call building back better, and we’re determined to make it count. I’m so grateful to our G7 colleagues joining us today. I’m sure you agree: at a time like this, the G7 can’t be anything but ambitious. And our G7 health track reflects that ambition. We want health security for all, working on international leadership on clinical trials, action on antimicrobial resistance, and to embrace the vast opportunities in digital health we’ve seen come to the fore over the last year. And the PPP can be instrumental in this agenda – especially in those first 2 strands: global health security and clinical trials. And there really is no better place to start than the G7. The reason we use the G7 is that that group represents two thirds of the global pharmaceutical market, the majority of the world’s genomic capability, a huge proportion of global research and development, and it leads the world in life sciences and clinical trials. So at our G7 meetings this summer, both at the health track and then the leaders, I want us to declare to the world how we can take this forward, how we can make vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics available and accessible in the vast quantities that we’re going to need to make the world safer. And responding to the call that has already been made to slash the time that’s need to develop and deploy vaccines by two thirds to just 100 days – and being equally ambitious about ensuring high-quality and effective therapeutics and diagnostics are available quickly after a new disease threat is identified. That’s the goal. But it remains just a wish, unless we plan. So I’m incredibly grateful to Sir Patrick and our 6 expert leads, for the work they’re going to do shaping advice and developing policy recommendations across the 3 workstreams. And if I just briefly touch on the 3. First, to Sir Andrew Witty and Sir John Bell, who will look at how we can accelerate research and development for new vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics and the technologies that are going to help us manufacture and deploy them across the globe. And in that mission, we need look no further than organisations like CEPI to see what is possible when we embrace new and dynamic types of partnership. CEPI’s mission – to find new vaccines for a safer world – is one the UK is firmly behind. Because vaccines of course are one of the most powerful tools we have. The UK will continue to support CEPI, and today I’m pleased to confirm a further £16 million investment. The funds are there to support CEPI’s work to boost manufacturing capacity around the world, all with the goal of making sure no one is left behind and taking us ever closer to the model of responsiveness that we need to prevent future pandemics. And that sort of model is one where we get the rapid adaption of vaccines to new diseases or new variants – within that 100-day goal – and deployment where they’re needed. Beyond vaccines, it is also imperative that we significantly enhance our speed of response to pick up new technologies, and in particular I want to mention the supply of novel antiviral treatments which later today the Prime Minister will be setting out the details of how we will be driving forward the deployment and development of antivirals here in the UK. A second team I want to give a shout out to and touch on is the work that Dame Anne Johnson and Professor Martin Landray are going to be doing on how we can improve clinical trials and data sharing. For me the pandemic has shown beyond measure the value of robust clinical trials. And, critically, the value of sticking with the clinical trial even when there is this incredible imperative to get treatments out fast. Finding what works, and, crucially, ruling out what doesn’t work. I’m sure all of us in our heads can think of treatments that have been trumpeted, sometimes from the highest office, as solutions, but clinical trials are the answer as we know to finding out what works. But we’ve got to get quicker. And if trials aren’t working to shared standards across borders, we risk losing precious time – and precious ingenuity. I’ve been struck by the fact that if clinical trials aren’t designed right with set standards at the start, then the data within them is not interoperable or not easily interoperable and therefore it takes longer to get a robust signal. This is something we can and must fix. Faced with another pandemic, those aren’t risks any of us should be prepared to take. We’ve got to hold onto these precious commodities – ingenuity and time – and use data and insights as fast as possible flowing freely across borders so the whole world can benefit. Here in the UK, the MHRA worked really hard to overcome some of the obstacles within the structure of clinical trials taking place in different jurisdictions. And that was one of the reasons we were able to license vaccines here in the UK faster than anywhere else in the UK, because of the flexibility yet robustness shown by the MHRA. And making sure that in future we have clinical trials that can get the power of all of the data used everywhere in the world is incredibly important. It requires set standards that we agree on in principle before those trials are structured. I know it’s possible. But it will take focus and it will take leadership – and that’s what the G7 can provide. And then the third point I want to briefly touch on is, of course, the money. I’m incredibly grateful to Baroness Minouche Shafik and Lord Jim O’Neill, who are working, along with the finance ministers’ track, on sustainable finance. Now let’s face it, the pandemic has been painfully expensive, not just in how much we’ve had to spend, but the hit to our economies too. Confronted with the same level of preparedness, we would risk being in the same boat. But in future, when we’re better prepared, we’ll be able to do it differently and do it better – with more targeted, more inventive and more sustainable financing initiatives. And here, crucially, it is absolutely vital that in peacetime, when there is not a pandemic on the horizon, we can bring in the financing that can ensure we stay prepared. So today is a fantastic chance to draw on the unmatched experience of this incredible group of people and put forward some big, bold ideas. Ideas that drive the plan that we’re working towards putting before G7 leaders in June and, ultimately, the plan that we’ll then put before the whole world. We’ve got to bring everyone with us as much as is possible on this vital mission and with the plan that we will develop through this team, with our plan – with your plan – I know that we can make it. So thank you very much for what you’re going to do and for the work that you’re doing in putting these plans in place and then to turn these plans into actions. It’s incredibly important and the work starts now."
"Boris Johnson","PM statement at the Leaders Summit on Climate: 22 April 2021","22 April 2021","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-statement-at-the-leaders-summit-on-climate-22-april-2021","I’d like to begin by thanking President Biden very much for bringing us together today in the way that he has and for setting out the problem in the eloquent way that he did at the beginning, and of course for returning the United States to the front rank of the fight against climate change. I’m really thrilled by the game-changing announcement that Joe Biden has just made. And I’m proud that the UK is doing the same. We were first country to pass legislation for net zero. We have the biggest offshore wind capacity of any country in the world, the Saudi Arabia of wind as I never tire of saying. We’re halfway to net zero. We have carbon emissions lower than at any point since the 19th century, we’re ending support for fossil fuels overseas and doubling our international climate finance. We’re actually speeding up because we see the obligations for developed countries to do more, we’re legislating to deliver 78% of the reductions needed to reach that goal by 2035. As host of COP26, we want to see similar ambitions around the world and we’re working with everybody, from the smallest nations to the biggest emitters to secure commitments that will keep change to within 1.5 degrees. And I think we can do it. And to do it we need the scientists and all of our countries to work together to produce the technological solutions that humanity is going to need. Whether it’s carbon capture and storage or solving the problems of cheap hydrogen delivery or getting to jet zero flying, getting to net zero flying, making sure that we can roll out EVs properly, making sure that our homes stop emitting such prodigious quantities of CO2, moving to sustainable domestic living. We can do this together across the world. It’s going to mean the richest nations coming together and exceeding the $100 billion commitment that they already made in 2009 and I stress how important that is. Plus, I think what President Xi had to say about the harmony with nature was absolutely vital. If we’re going to tackle climate change sustainably, we have to deal with the disaster of habitat loss and species loss across our planet and we want to see even more examples of government and private industry working hand in hand as with the newly launched LEAF Coalition to reduce deforestation and the multi-trillion dollar Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero. To do these things we’ve got to be constantly original and optimistic about new technology and new solutions whether that’s crops that are super-resistant to drought or more accurate weather forecasts like those we hope to see from the UK’s new Met Office 1.2bn supercomputer that we’re investing in. I’m not saying any of this is going to be easy. There is obviously going to be a political challenge. It’s important to go back to the original words of President Biden, it’s vital for all of us to show that this is not all about some expensive politically correct green act of ‘bunny hugging’ or however you want to put it. Nothing wrong with ‘bunny hugging’ but you know what I’m driving at. This is about growth and jobs and the President was absolutely right to stress that. I want to leave you with the thought that we can build back better from this pandemic by building back greener. Don’t forget that the UK has been able to cut our own CO2 emissions by about 42% on 1990 levels and we’ve seen our economy grow by 73%, you can do both at once. Cake have eat is my message to you. Let’s work together on this. Let’s go to Kunming in October and Glasgow in November armed with ambitious targets and the plans required to reach them. And let’s use this extraordinary moment and the incredible technology that we’re working on to make this decade the moment of decisive change in the fight against climate change and let’s do it together."
"Boris Johnson","Turning ambition into action for adaptation to the effects of climate change ahead of COP26","4 May 2021","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/turning-ambition-into-action-for-adaptation-to-the-effects-of-climate-change-ahead-of-cop26","Good afternoon. And thank you to everyone for joining this event, and to our German friends for co-hosting it. It is a real pleasure to help to launch this water sector initiative today. For too long, adaptation has been the poor cousin of mitigation. And – I can tell you – adaptation is very much a top priority for the UK’s COP26 Presidency. That is why the UK Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, launched the Adaption Action Coalition earlier this year, with our friends in Egypt, Bangladesh, Malawi, Netherlands and St Lucia. And I am very pleased so many members are with us at this event to share their experiences. The AAC builds on the Call to Action I launched with partners when I was UK Secretary of State for International Development, in 2019. It’s about converting the political ambition into action. So it is fantastic to see the AAC going strong, with this first event today. And, of course, its first international collaboration: the water tracker. We all know that, even if we reached net zero today, the world would still need to deal with significant climate shocks and disruption. And too often, water is a casualty. Whether through droughts, floods, or sea level rises, extreme weather events make it harder for communities to access clean water. This impacts health, it impacts livelihoods, food production and more. And ultimately threatens economic growth. But the very fact that water is so fundamental to life means responsibility is split between many different areas of individual governments. Policies can suffer from a lack of integration, and are harder to fund as a result. The tracker the Adaptation Action Coalition is launching today seeks to tackle those problems. And look at how water can be integrated across countries’ Nationally Determined Contributions, National Adaptation Plans, and national climate plans, creating detailed, consistent plans to help attract public and private funding, and demonstrating the impact we can have when we work together. This tracker is supported by the UK, and delivered in partnership with the Alliance for Global Water Adaptation, Sanitation and Water for All, as well as the Global Water Partnership. I very much look forward to hearing in Glasgow later this year about the progress that has been made. And I wish you the very best for your discussion today, which is about putting the vital ambitions of the AAC into practice. And of course helping to create a safer, more resilient world for all of us. Thank you."
"Boris Johnson","PM remarks at the Petersberg Climate Dialogue: 6 May 2021","6 May 2021","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-remarks-at-the-petersberg-climate-dialogue-6-may-2021","Good afternoon everyone, it’s great to be able to join you this year. Over the next few months I suspect we’re going to be hearing a great deal about Angela’s legacy, Chancellor Merkel’s legacy, the incredible impact she has had on Germany, on Europe and indeed on the world. And your work on climate change has been at the heart of that achievement. You presided over the very first COP, more than a quarter of a century ago and I hadn’t remembered that you were of course the driving force behind the great leap forward that was the Kyoto Protocol. And you created this now venerable institution in the climate calendar, an event that has consistently elevated climate change to the top of ministerial in-trays. That is very important right now because as Svenja says, we can’t allow action on climate change to become another victim of this appalling pandemic. This will be the decade in which we either rise up as one to tackle climate change together or else we sink together into the mire. And this year, at COP26, will be the moment at which the world chooses which of those two fates awaits us. But while the solution to our climate conundrum is on the surface of it simple - achieve net zero and limit the rise in global temperature to 1.5c - the complex nature of international diplomacy is such that we can’t just expect to make progress or hope to make progress in the 10 days of talks this November. The stakes are too high for COP26 to become some kind of last-minute dash to the line. And so it is absolutely vital that when we have time we should spend the next six months productively, untangling those knots and unblocking some of the stickiest issues. If we do the hard miles now I hope that in November we can meet in person in Glasgow to hammer out the final details of what must be an era-defining outcome for our planet and for future generations. And as hosts of COP26, we in the UK have a responsibility of course to make that happen. So throughout this year Alok and I are pulling every lever, using every opportunity to make COP the success it needs to be. And that, of course, includes next month’s G7 summit in Carbis Bay where leaders of the world’s biggest economies will be coming together, in person, face-to-face for the first time in far too long and climate change will be right at the heart of the agenda. For one thing I can tell you the meeting itself will be completely carbon neutral. But more significantly, it will be the first G7 at which every member has committed to hitting net zero by 2050. Though in Angela’s case, in Germany’s case now, 2045, congratulations to you on your drive and your ambition. That’s great news for our planet and shows us as G7 leading by example. But in Cornwall I want to see much more. I will be seeking commitments from G7 members to use their voices and their votes wherever and whenever possible to support the transition to net zero, kick start a green industrial revolution, and build economies that can withstand whatever our changing climate throws at us. And I also hope to secure a substantial pile of cash with which to help all countries to do that. We simply must meet our existing commitments on climate finance, that long-overdue $100 billion a year target, and then we must go further still. Because I think it is really up to us in the wealthier economies just to walk a mile in the shoes of developing nations. Who are more likely to feel the effects of climate change, less able to withstand the impact it has, and all the while striving to raise the living standards of billions of people. As those of us who have benefitted from 150 years of carbon-heavy industry lecture from the side lines about the need for clean growth. Developed nations cannot stop climate change on their own, but if we want others to leapfrog the dirty technology that did so much for us, then we have a moral and a practical obligation to help them do so. That means putting our money where our mouth is, which is why the UK recently doubled its climate finance contribution. At the G7 and other international fora I will not hesitate to bend the ear of my fellow leaders on the need for them to do the same. Because if all that emerges from COP26 is more hot air than we have absolutely no chance of keeping our planet cool. It must be a summit of agreement, of action, of deeds not words. For that to happen then over the next six months we must be relentless in our ambition and determination, laying the foundations on which success will be built. Today’s event is the latest stepping stone on the path to Glasgow. So let’s use it to show the world just how serious we are about delivering the change we need."
"Boris Johnson","Focussing on climate negotiations with six months to go until COP26","6 May 2021","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/focussing-on-climate-negotiations-with-six-months-to-go-until-cop26","Secretary General, Prime Minister Johnson, Chancellor Merkel, Svenja, Ministers, Friends. Today, I have the unique honour of being the only COP President-Designate to welcome ministers to the Petersberg Dialogue two years in a row. And it is a particular pleasure for me to be sitting next to my friend Minister Schulze as I do so. Svenja, let me start by congratulating you for the proposal that you put forward yesterday to make Germany net zero by 2045, coupled with enhanced near-term ambition. Colleagues will know that at last year’s Dialogue we quite rightly focused on the unfolding impacts of the coronavirus pandemic, and the importance of the green recovery. This year, with now less than six months to go to Glasgow, we are focusing on the negotiations. And I am very keen that we use every moment of our time over the next two days to delve into adaptation, into finance, and of course, the outstanding elements of the Paris Rulebook, as Svenja has just said. And we need to be exploring solutions to issues that require a political resolution. And we need to provide clear guidance to our negotiators on what is expected from them ahead of Glasgow. And we need to send a clear signal that the political will is there to reach a successful negotiated outcome at COP26. Now friends, we are now all too familiar with these video conferences. They can sometimes feel very formulaic. What I sometimes refer to as the ‘doom of Zoom’. But, I request that we do everything we can to make full use of the opportunity that we have now today and up to Glasgow. That we move beyond positional statements. Instead, let’s speak very frankly about what really matters to each of us, to each of our countries. And let’s engage in a genuine conversation about how we, as ministers, can best contribute to resolving these issues. It is only through flexibility, through leadership that we will find compromise. And it is through that that we will agree a balanced package that makes the goals of the Paris Agreement a reality. That is what each of us must bring to this virtual table today. And am really looking forward to the detailed discussions we’re going to have. But before we begin, I want to give you a quick but important update. As many of you will know, in March the United Kingdom held a Climate and Development Ministerial meeting. And we agreed at this to set-up a Taskforce on Access to Finance, which is absolutely vital for developing countries around the world. This will take a new, economy-wide approach to climate finance, aligning support behind developing country priorities. And I am very pleased to say that we have developed the draft concept note already, which I am going to invite partners to work with us in shaping and take this work forward. And we will make this available shortly on the COP26 website. For now that is all from me, I very much look forward to hearing from ministers and having an interactive discussion. Svenja, back to you."
"Boris Johnson","Rising to the challenges of the climate crisis by working together","7 May 2021","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/rising-to-the-challenges-of-the-climate-crisis-by-working-together","Good afternoon everyone. Let me start by echoing the sentiments of Prime Minister Boris Johnson, where he spoke about the fact that the Petersberg Dialogue is a testament to Chancellor Merkel’s legacy. From presiding over the first COP to creating the Petersberg Climate Dialogue, which, I think we can all appreciate, has become one of the most established moments in the international climate calendar. The Chancellor’s personal contribution to tackling the climate crisis should be recognised. Which now brings me to this year’s Petersberg Dialogue. Petersberg XII. This was the biggest so far. And indeed, even before the main ministerial meeting began we have had an impressive series of 8 satellite events. I want to thank my dear friend Minister Schulze and for her personal leadership and for us working so closely together on this agenda. As Svenja said, we have had ministers speaking and, of course, they said the right things, which is encouraging. Even virtually, I could see and I could hear that there is a strong political will to take action on the climate crisis and its crippling effects which face all of us across the world. We all know that this decade is absolutely key and that is why we have already spelt out our pathway to Glasgow to COP26 in November. Our key aim is to keep the chance of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees alive. We want to adapt to the impacts of the changing climate And to ensure the money, finance, is available to deliver on these aims. The UK is working with every nation to reach agreement on how to tackle climate change. I personally have met, virtually, physically with 115 Ministers around the world since my appointment. And we all know that more than 190 countries, world leaders and their delegations will arrive in Glasgow in Scotland in November. And this will be the largest international political gathering that the United Kingdom has ever hosted. And it’s only six months to go. And so I want to talk to you briefly through our around the four goals we want to achieve on the road and at COP26. First, we need to secure global net zero by mid-century so that we can keep the 1.5 degrees within reach. Countries are being asked to come forward with ambitious 2030 emissions reductions targets that align with reaching net zero by the middle of the century. And I’m urging all countries – especially the major emitters - to come forward with ambitious emissions reduction commitments. We are also working to accelerate the end of coal use, to accelerate the take up of zero emission vehicles, to curb deforestation, and encourage investment in renewables. Secondly, we want to see moves to adapt to protect communities and natural habitats. The climate is already changing and it will continue to change even as we reduce emissions, and this is likely to have some devastating effects. On the road to COP26 we need to work together to enable and encourage countries, and communities and businesses affected by climate change to build those defences, to put in place the warning systems and the resilient infrastructure and agriculture to avoid the loss of life and livelihoods. Third, we must have enough finance. This is absolutely vital. I cannot emphasise this point enough. To deliver on our first two goals, developed countries must make good on their promise to provide $100bn in climate finance per year. Both Governments and international financial institutions must play their part – and we must keep the promises that have been made and deliver on that. But we also need to work towards unleashing the trillions of dollars in private finance required to secure global net zero. And fourth, we must work together to deliver on these goals. We can only rise to the challenges of the climate crisis by working together. And frankly, friends, we must apply the same urgency to fighting climate change which we have applied to fighting the coronavirus. At COP26 we must complete the Paris Rulebook, and accelerate action to tackle the climate change crisis, through collaboration between governments, with businesses and, incredibly importantly, civil society as well. We have made some tangible progress together over the past two days, but I am urging all parties, all countries to maintain that momentum and collectively step up our efforts to find solutions. We know what needs to be done. But we also know that time is not on our side. To help us reach agreement, I will be tasking ministers to take forward certain issues in the negotiations ahead of Glasgow. I want to thank Minister Fu and Minister Koizumi for taking on the task of consulting with parties on Article 6. I will be announcing other pairings on key topics in the coming weeks. I also intend to convene a representative group of ministers again in-person in July to make further progress on these key issues that require a political resolution. Under the UK’s presidency this year, G7 members have had important conversations on climate change. And it is really great to see that all G7 members have now committed to reaching net zero emissions by 2050 at the latest, reinforced by strong near-term 2030 targets. And I very much welcome Germany’s proposal to achieve net zero by 2045, achieving 65% emissions cuts by 2030 and 88% by 2040 respectively. The UK has already pledged to slash emissions by 78% by 2035 and, very importantly, enshrined this in law. As Prime Minister Johnson made clear yesterday, we must arrive in Glasgow having done our homework. It is absolutely clear that finance is going to be crucial and I am calling on all G7 leaders to go further ahead of the Leaders’ Summit this June. Donor countries must consider what it is like to walk in the feet of communities in developing countries, who are on the front line of climate change. I’ve visited some of these communities. Their homes, livelihoods, their very lives are at risk. And we have to remember that these communities and countries have contributed least to climate change. So overall, in conclusion, we need to create the conditions so that the world is ready to reach agreement on an ambitious, on a comprehensive, and balanced set of outcomes that deliver a cleaner, greener world for our people and our planet. And we must ensure that no one and no issue is left behind in Glasgow."
"Boris Johnson","PM statement at coronavirus press conference: 10 May 2021","10 May 2021","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-statement-at-coronavirus-press-conference-10-may-2021","Good afternoon, I want to begin by thanking everyone again for your patience and for the sacrifices you’ve been making - businesses, pubs and restaurants that have been waiting to welcome customers back through their doors grandparents who have gone for months without seeing their grandchildren, weddings postponed, funerals sadly constrained, and religious festivals – such as Eid – yet again facing restrictions. And I want to thank you because your efforts have so visibly paid off giving us the time to vaccinate more than two thirds of all adults across the UK with more than one third – nearly 18 million people - also receiving their second dose – and thereby unquestionably saving many lives. So it is precisely because of your efforts, that I can confirm today we have met our four tests for further easing the lockdown in England. Chris will run through the details in a minute, but with deaths and hospitalisations at their lowest levels since last July, and the UK’s four Chief Medical Officers today agreeing a reduction in the alert level, the data now support moving to step 3 in England from next Monday 17th May. This means the Rule of Six or two households that has applied outdoors, will now apply indoors and the limit for outdoor meetings will increase to 30. From next Monday you will be able to sit inside a pub and inside a restaurant. You’ll be able to go to the cinema and children will be able to use indoor play areas. We’re re-opening hostels, hotels, and B&Bs. We’ll re-open the doors of our theatres, concert halls and business conference centres and unlock the turnstiles of our sports stadia, subject to capacity limits. And from next week everyone will be able to travel within Britain and stay overnight, meaning schools will also be able to organise trips with overnight stays. We will no longer require face coverings in classrooms – or for students in communal areas in secondary schools and colleges. All remaining University students will be able to return to in-person teaching, where they should be tested twice a week. We will increase the number of named visitors for those in care homes from two to five, and residents will have greater freedoms to leave their home without having to isolate on their return. This unlocking amounts to a very considerable step on the road back to normality and I am confident we will be able to go further. Subject to the impact of step 3 on the data, we remain on track to move to step 4 on 21st June and to give businesses more time to prepare, we’ll be saying more later this month about exactly what the world will look like and what role there could be – if any – for certification and social distancing. And today we are taking a step towards that moment when we learn to live responsibly with Covid – when we cease eventually to rely on detailed government edicts, and make our own decisions – based on the best scientific advice - about how to protect our families and those around us. So from next Monday we are updating the guidance on close contact between friends and family, setting out the risks for everyone to make their own choices. This does not mean we can suddenly throw caution to the winds. In fact, more than a year into this pandemic, we all know that close contact, such as hugging, is a direct way of transmitting this disease. So I urge you to think about the vulnerability of your loved ones - whether they have had a vaccine, one or two doses, and whether there has been time for that vaccine to take effect. Remember outdoors is always safer than indoors. And if you are meeting indoors, remember to open a window and let in the fresh air. Keep getting tested regularly, even if you don’t have symptoms, so you don’t spread the virus without knowing it. And whatever you decide, I must ask that you continue to follow social distancing when not with friends and family including in workplaces, shops, pubs, restaurants and other settings. We only have to look at the very sad situation in other countries to see the lethal potential of this virus and we must continue to fight the spread of variants here in the UK. While we have no evidence yet to believe these variants are completely vaccine resistant, we must remain vigilant. So please remember hands, face, space and fresh air. And as we mark Mental Health Awareness week, perhaps also take a moment to check in on friends and family and see how they are doing after all that we have been through together, or if you are struggling yourself, get the support you need. Today we are announcing the single biggest step on our roadmap and it will allow us to do many of the things we’ve yearned to do for a long time. So let’s protect these gains by continuing to exercise caution and common sense."
"Boris Johnson","PM House of Commons Statement on COVID: 12 May 2021","12 May 2021","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-house-of-commons-statement-on-covid-12-may-2021","Mr Speaker, with permission, I will update the House on our response to Covid. The patience and hard work of the British people has combined with the success of the vaccination programme to reduce deaths and hospitalisations to their lowest levels since last July, and from Monday, England will ease lockdown restrictions in line with step 3 of our roadmap. This will amount to the single biggest step of our journey back to normality. But after everything we have endured, we must be vigilant because the threat of this virus remains real and new variants pose a potentially lethal danger, including the one first identified in India which is of increasing concern here in the UK. So caution has to be our watchword. Our country - like every country – has found itself in the teeth of the gravest pandemic for a century, imposing heart-breaking sorrow on families across the world with more than 127,000 lives lost in our United Kingdom alone. And our grief would have been still greater without the daily heroism of the men and women of our National Health Service, the protection of our vaccines, already in the arms of over two-thirds of adults across the UK - and the dedication of everyone who has followed the rules and sacrificed so much that we cherish. Amid such tragedy, the State has an obligation to examine its actions as rigorously and candidly as possible, and to learn every lesson for the future, which is why I have always said that when the time is right there should be a full and independent inquiry. So Mr Speaker, I can confirm today that the Government will establish an independent public inquiry on a statutory basis, with full powers under the Inquiries Act of 2005, including the ability to compel the production of all relevant materials, and take oral evidence in public, under oath. In establishing the Inquiry, we will work closely with the Devolved Administrations as we have done throughout our pandemic response, and My Right Honourable Friend the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster has this morning spoken to the First Ministers of Scotland and Wales, and the First and Deputy First Ministers of Northern Ireland to begin those conversations. Every part of our United Kingdom has suffered the ravages of this virus, and every part of the State has pulled together to do battle against it, and if we are to recover as one Team UK – as we must - then we should also learn lessons together in the same spirit. So we will consult the devolved administrations before finalising scope and detailed arrangements, so that this Inquiry can consider all key aspects of the UK response. Mr Speaker, this process will place the State’s actions under the microscope, and we should be mindful of the scale of that undertaking and the resources required to do it properly. The exercise of identifying and disclosing all relevant information, the months of preparation and retrospective analysis, and the time that people will have to spend testifying in public, in some cases for days, will place a significant burden on our NHS, on the whole of government, on our scientific advisers, and on many others. We must not inadvertently divert and distract the very people on whom we all depend in the heat of our struggle against this disease. And the end of the lockdown is not the end of the pandemic. The World Health Organisation has said that the pandemic has now reached its global peak and will last throughout this year. Our own scientific advisers judge that although more positive data is coming in and the outlook is improving, there could still be another resurgence in hospitalisations and deaths. We also face the persistent threat of new variants, and should these prove highly transmissible and elude the protection of our vaccines, they would have the potential to cause even greater suffering than we endured in January. And there is in any case a high likelihood of a surge this Winter when the weather assists the transmission of all respiratory diseases and the pressure on our NHS is most acute. So I expect the right moment for the inquiry to begin is at the end of this period, in the Spring of next year, Spring 2022 Mr Speaker, I know there will be some in this Chamber and many bereaved families – who will be anxious for an Inquiry to begin sooner. So let me reassure the House, that we are fully committed to learning lessons at every stage of this crisis. We have already subjected our response to independent scrutiny including seventeen reports by the independent National Audit Office and fifty parliamentary inquiries - and we will continue to do so. We will continue to learn lessons as we have done throughout the pandemic. But no public inquiry could take place fast enough to assist in the very difficult judgements which will remain necessary throughout the rest of this year and the remainder of the pandemic. And we must not weigh down the efforts of those engaged in protecting us every day, thereby risk endangering further lives. Instead this Inquiry must be able to look at the events of the last year in the cold light of day - and identify the key issues that will make a difference for the future. Free to scrutinise every document, To hear from all the key players, and analyse and learn from the breadth of our response. That is the right way, I think, to get the answers that the people of this country deserve, And to ensure our United Kingdom is better prepared for any future pandemic. Mr Speaker, entirely separately from the Inquiry, there is a solemn duty on our whole United Kingdom to come together and cherish the memories of all those who have been lost. Like many across this Chamber, I was deeply moved when I visited the Covid Memorial Wall opposite Parliament, and I wholeheartedly support the plan for a Memorial in St Paul’s Cathedral, which will provide a fitting place of reflection in the heart of our capital. I also know that communities across our whole country will want to find ways of commemorating what we have all been through. So the Government will support their efforts by establishing a UK Commission on Covid Commemoration. This national endeavour - above party politics - will remember the loved ones we have lost; honour the heroism of those who saved lives and the courage of frontline workers who kept our country going; celebrate the genius of those who created the vaccines; and commemorate the small acts of kindness and the daily sacrifice of millions who stayed at home, buying time for our scientists to come to our rescue. We will set out the Commission membership and terms of reference in due course. And in telling the whole story of this era in our history, we will work again across our United Kingdom, together with the Devolved Administrations, to preserve the spirit which has sustained us in the gravest crisis since the Second World War, resolving to go forwards together, Mr Speaker, and to build back better. And I commend this statement to the House."
"Boris Johnson","PM statement at coronavirus press conference: 14 May 2021","14 May 2021","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-statement-at-coronavirus-press-conference-14-may-2021","Good afternoon throughout this pandemic we’ve tried to keep people abreast of the last information as soon as we get it. And since I spoke to you last Monday, we’ve seen further clusters of the B.1.617.2, the variant first observed in India, we’ve seen it especially in Bolton, Blackburn with Darwen and some other parts of the country. At this stage there are some important unknowns. We believe this variant is more transmissible than the previous one – in other words it passes more easily from person to person - but we don’t know by how much. I am told that if it’s only marginally more transmissible, we can continue more or less as planned. But if the virus is significantly more transmissible, we are likely to face some hard choices. We are going to be learning a lot more in the coming days and weeks about that. The good news is that so far we have no evidence to suggest our vaccines will be less effective in protecting people against severe illness and hospitalisation. So that means we are in a different position from the last time we face a new variant before Christmas because of the scale of our vaccine roll-out, which PHE estimates has already saved almost 12,000 lives and prevented over 33,000 people from being hospitalised. So I believe we should trust in our vaccines to protect the public whilst monitoring the situation very closely. Because the race between our vaccination programme and the virus may be about to become a great deal tighter. And it’s more important than ever therefore that people get the additional protection of a second dose. So following advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, we will accelerate remaining second doses to the over 50s and those clinically vulnerable right across the country so they are just eight weeks after the first dose, and if you are in this group the NHS will be in touch with you. We will also prioritise first doses for anyone eligible who has not yet come forwards, including the over 40s - and I urge anyone in those groups to come forwards as soon as you can. At this stage, there is no evidence of increased cases translating into unmanageable pressures on the NHS even in Bolton - and infections, deaths and hospitalisations nationally remain at their lowest levels since last Summer. So – and this is a balanced decision - I do not believe on present evidence that we need to delay our roadmap, and we will proceed with our plan to move to step 3 in England from Monday. But I have to level with you that this could be a serious disruption to our progress and could make it more difficult to move to step 4 in June, and I must again stress we will do whatever it takes to keep the public safe. Our surveillance and data gathering is now so advanced, that if there was a danger of the NHS coming under unsustainable pressure, we would see the signs in the data very early on and could react in good time, and that gives us the confidence to continue moving forwards for now. But I urge everyone to exercise the greatest caution because the choices we each make in the coming days will have a material effect on the road ahead. To those living in Bolton and Blackburn, I am very sorry that you are once again suffering from this virus. I know how hard it has been for you, having been in a form of national or local lockdown for longer than almost everywhere else. But now it is more vital than ever that you play your part in stopping the spread. We will not be preventing businesses from reopening on Monday, but we will be asking you to do your bit. Take the vaccine when you can. Get your free, twice-weekly rapid tests. If you do test positive, you must self-isolate – and we’ll provide financial support, to help to those on low incomes to help them do so. And as we move away from living our lives by government rules and as we learn to live with this virus, then, as I said on Monday, we need to make our own decisions about how best to protect ourselves and our loved ones - informed by the risks. And for those living in Bolton and other affected areas, there is now a greater risk from this new variant so I urge you to be extra cautious. Our best chance of suppressing this variant is to clamp down on it where it is and we will be throwing everything we can at this task. Colonel Russ Miller – Commander of the North West Region - will be deployed to support local leaders in managing the response on the ground. There will be surge testing, with mobile testing units, and the army will be on the streets handing out tests. And there will targeted new activity in Bolton and Blackburn to accelerate vaccine take-up among eligible cohorts – including longer opening hours at vaccination sites. And to everyone across the whole country, wherever you live, please get tested twice a week for free, get a jab if you are eligible, remember hands, face, space and fresh air observe social distancing from those you do not know, and if you are seeing loved ones think really carefully about the risk to them especially if they have not had that second dose – or it hasn’t yet had the time to take full effect. I want us to trust people to be responsible and to do the right thing. That’s the way to live with this virus, while protecting our NHS and restoring our freedoms. And it’s very clear now we are going to have to live with this new variant of the virus as well for some time. So let’s work together – and let’s exercise caution and common sense."
"Boris Johnson","Human Rights Council Special Session: UK statement on the deteriorating human rights situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territory","27 May 2021","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/human-rights-council-special-session-uk-statement-on-the-deteriorating-human-rights-situation-in-the-occupied-palestinian-territory","The United Kingdom strongly welcomes the ceasefire in Israel and Gaza. The Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab travelled to the region this week to support efforts to ensure the ceasefire is permanent, which is a necessary step to ending the cycle of violence. I offer Boris Johnson’s deepest condolences to the families of those civilians killed. Each one of those deaths was and is a tragedy. The recent conflict demonstrates the urgent need to make progress towards a more positive future for Israelis and Palestinians alike. During the recent escalation in violence, the UK has unequivocally condemned indiscriminate attacks by Hamas and other militant groups on Israel. We are clear that Israel has a legitimate right to self-defence. All actions taken when exercising that right must be consistent with the principles of distinction, proportionality, humanity and necessity, in line with International Humanitarian Law, and avoid civilian casualties. We are gravely concerned about the humanitarian situation in Gaza. That is why the UK has provided an initial £3.2 million of aid to UNRWA’s emergency flash appeal to help address the immediate humanitarian needs. We continue to push for unhindered humanitarian access into Gaza. As we work to rebuild calm, the UK will continue to call on all actors to adhere to International Humanitarian Law. We consistently oppose settlements, demolitions and evictions across the West Bank, including in East Jerusalem. Settlements are illegal under international law and damage the prospects for peace. We applaud the efforts of all who have engaged with the parties in recent days to ensure that the ceasefire is durable and to find a way to improve the lives of Palestinians. As Dominic Raab has made clear in his meetings with the Israeli and Palestinian leadership, the UK will continue to work to find a durable resolution to the conflict. We continue to believe that the only sustainable solution is a two state solution, leading to a safe and secure Israel, living alongside a viable and sovereign Palestinian state, based on 1967 lines, with Jerusalem as the shared capital of both states."
"Boris Johnson","Boris Johnson: G7 Summit is a chance to show the world our values","10 June 2021","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/boris-johnson-g7-summit-is-a-chance-to-show-the-world-our-values","When the leaders of the G7 arrive on the golden strand of Carbis Bay, it will be an extraordinary moment for that lovely Cornish resort — and a crucial moment for the world. This is the first visit by President Biden to the European continent after five months in office. It is the first time that the leaders of the world’s richest and most powerful democracies have had the chance to meet in person since the pandemic began 18 months ago — and it could not come at a better time. The world needs this meeting. We must be honest: international order and solidarity were badly shaken by COVID. Nations were reduced to beggar my neighbour tactics in the desperate search for PPE, for drugs — and, finally, for vaccines. At Carbis Bay, we must put those days behind us. This is the moment for the world’s greatest and most technologically advanced democracies to shoulder their responsibilities and to vaccinate the world, because no one can be properly protected until everyone has been protected. We can already be proud of what we have done. It was the deal done between the British government, Oxford scientists and AstraZeneca that ensured this vaccine is now being distributed at cost around the world. As a direct result, 95 per cent of the vaccines distributed by Covax, the global vaccine alliance, are AstraZeneca — and we intend to go further. At Carbis Bay, the G7 will pledge to distribute vaccines to inoculate the world by the end of next year, with millions coming from surplus UK stocks. We will begin the framing of a new global treaty on pandemic preparedness so the world is never caught out in the same way again. And we will go further in strengthening the political and economic ties between us, relaunching the G7 as a means of expressing the values that unite us: openness, freedom, democracy and free trade. We will be joined by our friends, the leaders of India, South Korea, Australia and South Africa, a Democratic XI, with the UK a competitive and creative player in the centre of the field. We will work together to tackle the world’s biggest problems, reducing carbon emissions, fighting the loss of biodiversity and getting another 40 million girls into school by 2025. With the US we will be drawing up a new Atlantic Charter, 80 years after Churchill and Roosevelt agreed the first in 1941 on the deck of HMS Prince of Wales. It is fitting that this week that battleship’s linear successor will provide the backdrop. President Biden and I will sign a charter that encompasses science, technology and trade and, above all, that underscores our joint commitment to Nato that has been indispensable to our security for decades. The time has come to dispel any sense of gloom and show how Nato is looking ahead to 2030, reinvigorating its plans and doctrines, protecting our allies on Europe’s eastern flank and safeguarding our people in the new domains of space and cyberspace. Britain has the biggest defence budget in Europe, making us central to this effort. We are contributing more troops than any other country to Nato’s deployment in Poland and the Baltic states. We have committed our nuclear deterrent and our cybercapabilities to the alliance. Britain is doing more to guarantee the security of our continent than any other European power. Wherever you look — the G7, Nato, the global struggle against COVID — Britain is the “buckle that fastens, the hyphen that joins” everything together, to adopt Walter Bagehot’s phrase. We can do this because of the breadth of our capabilities and friendships. The UK can at once devise a vaccine against COVID, conduct nearly half of the world’s genomic sequencing of new variants, bring the world’s most powerful leaders to Cornwall, and send an aircraft carrier to the Indo-Pacific. But we would never wish to go it alone; on the contrary, we are blessed with alliances that help to keep us safe and advance our values. Now we are putting all of this to work for the benefit of the British people and to ensure this country is a force for good."
"Boris Johnson","Tackling common challenges together with the European Union","10 June 2021","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/tackling-common-challenges-together-with-the-european-union","Thank you, Mr President. We very much welcome High Representative Borrell’s attendance at the Council today and thank him for his briefing. We agree entirely with his emphasis on the importance of multilateralism. The UN-centred international rules-based system provides a foundation for coordinated and collective action, including through regional organisations, in order to address our biggest challenges, as exemplified so eloquently just now by Ambassador Kimani. We welcome the role the EU has played in upholding international norms across a range of fora - from the G7 to the United Nations, including through the UNHRC special session on Myanmar that we jointly chaired earlier this year. As High Representative Borrell set out, there is no greater global challenge than that posed by COVID-19. As Foreign Secretary Raab emphasised in this Council in February, and as we subsequently agreed in Resolution 2565, combatting and sustainably recovering from COVID-19 requires greater national, regional, and international cooperation and solidarity. So we welcome the EU’s staunch support, as High Representative Borrell said, for the ACT-Accelerator and EU financial contributions to COVAX. The UK was proud to host the Global Vaccine Summit just over a year ago, which surpassed its target and raised $8.8 billion. We have made some progress but there is more to do. We look forward to continued co-operation with the EU as we work to recover from COVID-19 and better prepare ourselves for future pandemics, including through our shared support for a global pandemic treaty. And we look forward to welcoming the Secretary-General and the Presidents of the European Council and European Commission to the UK later this week for the G7 leaders meeting. We are using our G7 Presidency to promote global health objectives and to support the world’s poorest. Our shared work will need to continue at pace after the G7 as we head towards COP26 in Glasgow, where we hope that the world can finally turn the tide on the climate crisis. We are grateful for the steps already taken by the European Union, including the submission of an ambitious 2030 NDC. We count on the European Union’s support for an ambitious outcome and a cleaner, greener future for us all, but especially for those countries most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change – the same countries that Prime Minister Johnson and other world leaders called on us to support in this Council in February. And I want to thank Mr Borrell for the important point he made about the link between climate change and climate security and the need for us to address that issue in this Council. Mr President, multilateralism continues to be central to addressing issues within the European sphere. Along with the European Union and other international partners, we have repeatedly called on Russia in the OSCE to cease its destabilising action in Ukraine. The United Kingdom will continue to work with the European Union and other partners in support of international law and the wider rules-based international system to defend Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders. On Belarus, we share High Representative Borrell’s concern regarding the actions of the Belarusian authorities, including the forced landing of flight FR4978 and arrest of journalist Roman Protasevich. We continue to urge the Belarusian authorities to respect the will of the Belarusian people as well as their fundamental freedoms, human rights and the rule of law. On the Western Balkans, we strongly support the EU-facilitated Dialogue, under EU Special Representative Miroslav Lajcak, on the normalisation of relations between Serbia and Kosovo. We continue to encourage closer cooperation between the EU and NATO, to promote democratic values, prevent destabilisation, and facilitate progress towards European and Euro-Atlantic integration. The UK continues to play a significant role in the NATO presence in the Western Balkans, working with partners including EUFOR Op Althea in Bosnia and Herzegovina, to support defence reform and peace. Mr President, High Representative Borrell underlined the primary responsibility of this Council for the maintenance of international peace and security. And we recognise the contribution of the EU towards resolving issues on this Council’s agenda. This includes the role of the EU in support of a diplomatic solution to the revitalisation and restoration the JCPoA. We continue to work together to bring Iran back into compliance with its commitments and restore the benefits of this deal for all parties. The EU and UK continue to work closely on Libya, including through engagement with the Berlin process towards a sustainable, Libyan-owned political settlement. And we support continued efforts to enforce the UN arms embargo through EUNAVFOR Operation IRINI. We welcome the EU’s continued focus on Africa, as set out just now by Ambassador Kimani. In Somalia, we have been united with the EU and other international partners in calling for a consensus-based way forward on elections, and welcome the recent agreement between Somali leaders to that end. And of course we strongly support the work of the AU’s AMISOM mission, and hope that the EU will be able to continue its essential financial support to building Somali security. Mr President, as we have shown in our work in the G7, here in New York at the UN, and across a range of shared global challenges, the EU and the UK share a resolve to tackle the common challenges we all face. This has included supporting human rights – including, as Mr Borrell said, for those in Hong Kong – tackling conflict, coordinating on human rights sanctions and promoting the rights and prosperity of women including through girls’ education. I think you will agree, Mr President, that when we work together we are a force for the good in the world. Thank you."
"Boris Johnson","Boris Johnson: A billion vaccines, and education – my agenda for a global recovery","11 June 2021","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/boris-johnson-a-billion-vaccines-and-education-my-agenda-for-a-global-recovery","Nothing could provide more compelling or tragic proof of the necessity of global cooperation than the pandemic which has swept the world and claimed over 3.7 million lives. For the first time since the onset of this catastrophe, leaders of the G7 will meet in person for a summit that I will chair in Cornwall in the United Kingdom. I have also invited the Prime Ministers of India and Australia and the Presidents of South Korea and South Africa, allowing a broader gathering of fellow democracies and free societies. Our shared task is to overcome the pandemic, minimise the risk of any recurrence and build back better after this tragedy. Around the table in Cornwall will be the world’s biggest and most advanced economies, ready to deploy our capabilities and expertise against a common enemy. The genius and perseverance of our scientists has given us safe and effective vaccines against COVID-19. Now our most pressing task is to use them to protect humanity as swiftly as possible. The UK helped to established COVAX, the global alliance that has so far supplied 80 million doses to developing countries. Almost all have been the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, developed with British government support – using expertise from every part of the UK – precisely so that it would be cheap to administer and easy to store, capable of protecting the maximum number of people worldwide. Britain has contributed £548 million to COVAX and we will also donate the vast majority of any surplus doses from our domestic vaccination programme. But in the heat of emergency, we must all strive even harder. So I want the G7 to adopt an exacting yet profoundly necessary target: to provide one billion doses to developing countries in order to vaccinate everyone in the world by the end of next year. Nothing like this has ever been tried before and if you doubt whether it can be done, I would urge you to take heart from the unprecedented feats already achieved in the adversity of this pandemic. Our scientists devised vaccines against COVID-19 faster than any disease had ever been overcome before. Britain and many other countries are inoculating their populations more swiftly than anyone thought possible. Now we must bring the same spirit of urgency and ingenuity to a global endeavour to protect humanity everywhere. It can be done, it must be done – and this G7 summit should resolve that it will be done. But the reality is that even if we succeed, our efforts would count for little if another lethal virus were to emerge and inflict disaster all over again. So we need to strengthen our collective ability to prevent another pandemic and provide early warning of future threats, including by creating a network of surveillance centres – a Global Pandemic Radar. Our scientists took just 300 days to crack COVID and produce the vaccines, but we need to be able to respond even more rapidly. This G7 summit will begin a new effort to accelerate the development of vaccines, treatments and tests for any new virus from 300 to 100 days. Even as we minimise the risk of another catastrophe, we have an obligation to ensure that something good might come from today’s ordeal. We must build back better with a global economic recovery based on greener and fairer foundations. It remains a moral outrage – and a grave impediment to economic growth – that millions of girls around the world are denied an education, holding back the development of entire societies. Our shared goal must be to get another 40 million girls into school by 2025. I will ask the G7 and our guests to contribute more towards the Global Partnership for Education’s target of raising $5 billion for schools in the developing world. As more children enter the classrooms, we must create jobs to match their talent and safeguard the environment they will inherit. The G7 can take forward both aims by supporting a green industrial revolution and promising to halve our carbon emissions by 2030, in order to limit the rise in global temperatures to 1.5 degrees. We will bring the world together to strive towards this essential goal when the UK hosts the COP26 conference in Glasgow in November. In the meantime, I want the G7 to safeguard biodiversity for future generations by pledging to protect at least 30 percent of our land and oceans by 2030. And we should offer developing countries the high quality and transparent investment they need to build clean and green national infrastructure, turbocharging their economies. This is a compelling agenda for global recovery, ambitious yet achievable, provided we summon the will and the ingenuity. Britain is privileged to chair the G7 and to play our part, alongside our kindred democracies, in setting this immense effort in train. The scale of the challenge demands no less."
"Boris Johnson","PM Boris Johnson's remarks at the first session of the G7 Summit: 11 June 2021","11 June 2021","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-boris-johnsons-remarks-at-the-first-session-of-the-g7-summit-11-june-2021","Can I begin by welcoming you all here to Carbis Bay. It’s genuinely wonderful to see everybody in person, I can’t say what a difference it makes. You’ve all been going through the most wretched pandemic the world has faced for at least our lifetimes. I actually think that this is a meeting that genuinely needs to happen because we need to make sure we learn lessons from the pandemic. We need to make sure we don’t repeat some of the errors that we have made in the course of the last 18 months or so and we put in place what is needed to allow our economies to recover. They have the potential to bounce back very strongly and we have all sorts of reasons to be optimistic, but it is vital that we don’t repeat the mistakes of the last great crisis, the last big economic recession of 2008 when the recovery was not uniform across all part of society. What’s gone wrong with this pandemic, what risks being a lasting scar, is the inequalities that have been entrenched. We need to make sure that as we recover, we level up across our societies - we need to build back better. I actually think that we have a huge opportunity to do that, because as a G7 we are united in our vision for a cleaner, greener world. A solution to the problems of climate change in all those ideas, in those technologies, that we’re all addressing. Together I think there is a potential to generate many, many millions of high wage, high skilled jobs and I think that is what the people of our countries now want us to focus on. They want to be sure that we’re beating the pandemic together and discussing how to never have a repeat of what we’ve seen. But also that we’re building back better together. And building back greener. And building back fairer. And building back more equal. Maybe in a more gender neutral, a more feminine, way. So those are some of the objectives we have before us today. Thank you all very, very much."
"Boris Johnson","PM statement at the G7 Summit: 13 June 2021","13 June 2021","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-statement-at-the-g7-summit-13-june-2021","This Summit was the first gathering of G7 leaders – in fact the first gathering of pretty much any leaders – in almost two years. And I know the world was looking to us to reject some of the selfishness and nationalist approaches that have marred the initial global response to the pandemic, and to channel all our diplomatic, economic and scientific might into defeating covid for good. And I do hope we have lived up to some of the most optimistic of hopes and predictions I should say I am sorry to hear that, owing to their pre-existing commitments, the England football team are not able to watch this press conference live in the way I’m sure they’d like to. But I hope that, following their resounding victory, they will be able to catch up on the triumphs of the G7 later on. A week ago I asked my fellow leaders to help in preparing and providing the doses we need to help vaccinate the whole world by the end of 2022. I’m very pleased to announce that this weekend leaders have pledged over 1 billion doses - either directly or through funding to COVAX – that includes 100 million from the UK, to the world’s poorest countries – which is another big step towards vaccinating the world. And that’s in addition to everything scientists and governments and the pharmaceutical industry have done so far to roll out one of the largest vaccination programmes in history. And here I want to mention, in particular, the role the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine – the world’s most popular vaccine, developed 250 miles from where I’m standing today- by scientists who have rightly been given honours by the Queen this weekend. Today over half a billion people are safe because of the development and production of that vaccine, funded – I may add – by the UK Government. And that number is rising every day. It is popular, of course, because it is being sold at cost to the world and it was designed for ease of use in mind. And because of that act of generosity by AstraZeneca who, just to reiterate, are making zero profit on the production of that vaccine, millions more vaccines have been rolled out to the poorest countries in the world. In fact 96% of the vaccines delivered by the COVAX distribution scheme have been Oxford-AZ. But this weekend our discussions went far beyond defeating the pandemic. We looked towards the great global recovery our countries have committed to lead, and we were clear that we all need to build back better in a way that delivers for all our people and for the people of the world. And that means preventing a pandemic like this from ever happening again, apart from anything else by establishing a global pandemic radar which will spot new diseases before they get the chance to spread. It means ensuring that our future prosperity benefits all the citizens of our countries and indeed all the citizens of the world. At the G7 Summit this weekend, my fellow leaders helped the Global Partnership for Education - an organisation working to make sure that every child in the world is given the chance of a proper education – reach half of its five-year fundraising goal, including a £430m donation from the UK. It’s an international disgrace that some children in the world are denied the chance to learn and reach their full potential, and I’m very very pleased that the G7 came together to support that cause. Because educating all children, particularly girls, is one of the easiest ways to lift countries out of poverty and help them rebound from the coronavirus crisis. With just one additional year of school a girl’s future earnings can increase by 20%. I’m proud that G7 countries have agreed to get 40 million more girls into school and 20 million more reading by the end of primary school in the next five years, and the money we have raised this week is a fantastic start. But of course the world cannot have a prosperous future if we don’t work together to tackle climate change. Later this year the UK will host the COP26 Summit, which will galvanise global action on fighting climate change and create a healthy planet for our children and grandchildren. G7 countries account for 20% of global carbon emissions, and we were clear this weekend that action has to start with us. Carbis Bay is one of the most beautiful places in the world as you can see and it was a fitting setting for the first ever net zero G7 Summit. And while it’s fantastic that every one of the G7 countries has pledged to wipe out our contributions to climate change, we need to make sure we’re achieving that as fast as we can and helping developing countries at the same time. And what unites the countries gathered here this weekend – not just the G7 but Australia, India, South Africa and South Korea who have joined us (I should say in India’s case joined us virtually) not just our resolve to tackle climate change, but also our democratic values. It’s not good enough for us to just rest on our laurels and talk about how important those values are. And this isn’t about imposing our values on the rest of the world. What we as the G7 need to do is demonstrate the benefits of democracy and freedom and human rights to rest of the world. And we can partly achieve that by the greatest feat in medical history - vaccinating the world. We can do that by working together to stop the devastation that coronavirus has produced from ever occurring again. And we can do that by showing the value of giving every girl in the world access to 12 years of quality education. And we can also do that by coming together as the G7 and helping the world’s poorest countries to develop themselves in a way that is clean and green and sustainable I want to thank finally, the police, everyone who helped organised this summit and all the people not just of Carbis bay (who certainly helped us put the carbs into Carbis Bay), but all the wonderful people of Cornwall for their hospitality. It’s been a fantastic summit and I know that all the other delegations would want to express their thanks as well"
"Boris Johnson","PM statement at coronavirus press conference: 14 June 2021","14 June 2021","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-statement-at-coronavirus-press-conference-14-june-2021","When we set out on our roadmap to freedom a few months ago, we were determined to make progress that was cautious but irreversible. And step by step – thanks to the enormous efforts of the British people and the spectacular vaccine roll-out we now have one of the most open economies and societies in this part of the world. And as we have always known and as the February roadmap explicitly predicted – this opening up has inevitably been accompanied by more infection and more hospitalisation. Because we must be clear that we cannot simply eliminate Covid – we must learn to live with it. And with every day that goes by we are better protected by the vaccines and we are better able to live with the disease. Vaccination greatly reduces transmission and two doses provide a very high degree of protection against serious illness and death. But there are still millions of younger adults who have not been vaccinated and sadly a proportion of the elderly and vulnerable may still succumb even if they have had two jabs. And that is why we are so concerned by the Delta variant that is now spreading faster than the third wave predicted in the February roadmap. We’re seeing cases growing by about 64 per cent per week, and in the worst affected areas, it’s doubling every week. And the average number of people being admitted to hospital in England has increased by 50 per cent week on week, and by 61 per cent in the North West, which may be the shape of things to come. Because we know the remorseless logic of exponential growth and even if the link between infection and hospitalisation has been weakened it has not been severed. And even if the link between hospitalisation and death has also been weakened, I’m afraid numbers in intensive care, in ICU are also rising. And so we have faced a very difficult choice. We can simply keep going with all of step 4 on June 21st even though there is a real possibility that the virus will outrun the vaccines and that thousands more deaths would ensue that could otherwise have been avoided. Or else we can give our NHS a few more crucial weeks to get those remaining jabs into the arms of those who need them. And since today I cannot say that we have met all four tests for proceeding with step four, I do think it is sensible to wait just a little longer. By Monday 19th July we will aim to have double jabbed around two thirds of the adult population including everyone over 50, all the vulnerable, all the frontline health and care workers and everyone over 40 who received their first dose by mid-May. And to do this we will now accelerate the 2nd jabs for those over 40 – just as we did for the vulnerable groups – so they get maximum protection as fast as possible. And we will bring forward our target to give every adult in this country a first dose by 19th July that is including young people over the age of 18 with 23 and 24 year olds invited to book jabs from tomorrow - so we reduce the risk of transmission among groups that mix the most. And to give the NHS that extra time we will hold off step 4 openings until July 19th except for weddings that can still go ahead with more than 30 guests provided social distancing remains in place and the same will apply to wakes. And we will continue the pilot events – such as Euro2020 and some theatrical performances. We will monitor the position every day and if after 2 weeks we have concluded that the risk has diminished then we reserve the possibility of proceeding to Step 4 and full opening sooner. As things stand – and on the basis of the evidence I can see right now – I am confident we will not need any more than 4 weeks and we won’t need to go beyond July 19th. It is unmistakably clear the vaccines are working and the sheer scale of the vaccine roll-out has made our position incomparably better than in previous waves. But now is the time to ease off the accelerator because by being cautious now we have the chance – in the next four weeks – to save many thousands of lives by vaccinating millions more people. And once the adults of this country have been overwhelmingly vaccinated, which is what we can achieve in a short space of time, we will be in a far stronger position to keep hospitalisations down, to live with this disease, and to complete our cautious but irreversible roadmap to freedom."
"Boris Johnson","PM statement to the House of Commons on G7 and NATO: 16 June 2021","16 June 2021","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-statement-to-the-house-of-commons-on-g7-and-nato-16-june-2021","Mr Speaker, with permission I will make a statement on the G7 summit I chaired in Carbis Bay and the Nato summit in Brussels. Let me first thank the people of Cornwall, Carbis Bay, St Ives, for welcoming the representatives of the world’s most powerful democracies to their home, an enchanting setting for the first gathering of G7 leaders in two years, the first since the pandemic began, and President Biden’s first overseas visit since taking office. Our aim was to demonstrate how the world’s democracies are ready and able to address the world’s toughest problems, offering solutions and backing them up with concrete action. The G7 will combine our strengths and expertise to defeat Covid, minimise the risk of another pandemic, and build back better, fairer and greener, for the benefit of all. Alongside our partners, the G7 is now engaged in the biggest and fastest vaccination programme in history, designed to protect the whole world by the end of next year. My fellow leaders agreed to supply developing countries with another billion doses - either directly or through other channels - of which 100 million will come from the UK. The world’s most popular vaccine was developed here and the express purpose of the deal between the British Government, Oxford University and AstraZeneca was to create an inoculation that would be easy to store, quick to distribute and available at cost price - or zero profit – to protect as many people as humanly possible. The results are becoming clearer every day: over 500 million Oxford AstraZeneca vaccines have been administered in 168 countries so far, accounting for 96 percent of the doses distributed to developing nations by COVAX, the global alliance that the UK helped to establish. With every passing hour, people are being protected across the world – and lives saved – by the formidable expertise that the UK was able to assemble. But all the efforts of this country and of many others, no matter how generous and far-sighted, would be futile in the face of another lethal virus that might escape our efforts. So the G7 has agreed to support a Global Pandemic Radar to spot new pathogens before they begin to spread, allowing immediate containment, and in case a new virus gets through anyway, our scientists will embark on a mission to develop the ability to create new vaccines, treatments and tests in just 100 days, compared to the 300 required for Covid. Even as we persevere against this virus, my fellow leaders share my determination to look beyond today’s crisis and build back better, greener and fairer. If we can learn anything from this tragedy, we have at least been given a chance to break with the past and do things better and do them differently. This time, as our economies rebound, we must avoid the mistakes we made after the financial crash of 2008 and ensure that everyone benefits from the recovery. The surest way of our future prosperity is to design fair and open rules and standards for the new frontiers of the global economy. So the G7 will devise a fairer tax system for global corporations, reversing the race to the bottom, and strive to ensure that new technology serves as a force for prosperity and hope, strengthening freedom and openness. My fellow leaders will act as one against an increasing injustice – the denial of an education to millions of girls across the world – by working to get another 40 million girls into school by 2025. I am happy to say that the G7 agreed to provide more than half of the $5 billion sought by the Global Partnership for Education to transform the prospects of millions of children in developing countries, and £430 million will come from the UK. Our duty to future generations compels us to protect our planet from catastrophic climate change and every country in the G7 has promised to achieve net zero by 2050 – wiping out our contribution to global warming from that date onwards – and to achieve that target we will halve our carbon emissions by 2030, compared with 2010 levels. The G7 resolved to end any government support for unabated coal-fired power generation overseas, and increase and improve climate finance between now and 2025. We will consecrate 30 percent of our land and sea to nature, protecting vast areas in all their abundance and diversity of life, giving millions of species the chance to recover from the ravages of recent decades. And it is precisely because safeguarding our planet requires global action that the G7 will offer developing countries a new partnership – the Build Back Better World – to help construct new and clean and green infrastructure in a way that is transparent and environmentally responsible. There is no contradiction between averting climate change and creating highly skilled and well paid jobs, both in our country and around the world. We can and will achieve both, by means of a green industrial revolution at home and green infrastructure abroad. I was honoured to welcome our friends, the leaders of India, South Korea, Australia and South Africa, as guests in Carbis Bay, virtually of course in the case of the prime minister of India. And on Monday, Scott Morrison and I were delighted to reach a free trade agreement between the UK and Australia, creating fantastic opportunities for both our countries, eliminating tariffs on all British exports - whether Scotch whisky or cars from the Midlands and making it easier for young British people to live and work in Australia. We’ve also included protections for British farmers over the next 15 years and unprecedented protections and provisions for animal welfare, and this House will of course be able to scrutinise the agreement, once the texts are finalised. This is exactly how Global Britain will help to generate jobs and opportunities at home and level up our whole United Kingdom. Our agreement with Australia is a vital step towards the even greater prize of the UK joining the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a $9 trillion free trade area embracing the fastest growing economies of the world. Together with the G7, the countries represented at Carbis Bay comprise a Democratic XI, free nations living on five continents, spanning different faiths and cultures, but united by a shared belief in liberty, democracy and human rights. Those ideals were encapsulated in the Atlantic Charter, agreed by Winston Churchill and President Roosevelt in 1941, when Britain was the only surviving democracy in Europe and the very existence of our freedom was in peril. The courage and valour of millions of people ensured our ideals survived and flourished. Eighty years on, President Biden and I met within sight of HMS Prince of Wales, the Royal Navy’s newest aircraft carrier and the linear successor of the battleship on which the original Charter was devised, and agreed a New Atlantic Charter, encompassing the full breadth of British and American cooperation in science, technology, trade and global security. The surest guarantee of our security is NATO, which protects a billion people in 30 countries, and the summit in Brussels on Monday agreed the wholesale modernisation of the alliance to meet new dangers, including in space and cyberspace, reflecting the priorities of our own Integrated Review of foreign and defence policy. Britain has the biggest defence budget in Europe, comfortably exceeding the NATO target of 2 percent of national income. We have committed our nuclear deterrent and our cyber capabilities to the alliance and we contribute more troops than any other country to NATO’s deployment to protect Poland and the Baltic states. We do more for the security of our continent than any other European power, showing that we mean it when we say that an attack on any NATO ally shall be considered an attack on all, a pledge that has kept the peace for over 70 years, and which President Biden reaffirmed on behalf of the United States. Together these two summits showed the enduring strength of the Atlantic Alliance and the bonds we treasure with kindred democracies across the globe. They provided the best possible foundation for COP26 in Glasgow in November, when the UK will bring the whole world together in a common cause. They demonstrated how Global Britain creates jobs at home, while striving in unison with our friends for a greener, safer and fairer world. Mr Speaker, I commend this statement to the House."
"Boris Johnson","G7 Summit — uniting for a fairer, greener and prosperous future","20 June 2021","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/g7-summit-uniting-for-a-fairer-greener-and-prosperous-future","The G7 grouping of countries is an easy one to criticise. As someone who has attended several of these summits, I know well the risks of them becoming talking shops with wordy communiques that are forgotten the moment the ink dries. Beyond the theatre, and the perennial questions of how to make this format inclusive, the real test is whether the agreements reached had any substance. This year, the group needed to show that countries could come together and address how we can all build back better from the pandemic, and unite to make the future greener and fairer. The summit did this on three important shared challenges: coronavirus, climate change, and giving all girls a good education. All three are issues on which Pakistan is a vital partner. First, on coronavirus, the G7 agreed that no-one is safe until everyone is safe. They recognised that we must work together to prevent an international catastrophe like Covid-19 from happening again. The UK’s own world-leading scientists developed the Oxford University-AstraZeneca vaccine which is now saving lives around the globe including in Pakistan. At the summit, the UK pledged to donate at least 100 million surplus vaccine doses within the next year, including 5 million starting in the coming weeks, and out of a total of 1 billion doses pledged by the G7; that’s on top of the £548 million we have committed to the global Covax facility so far, which will help supply at least 1.3 billion vaccine doses to over 90 countries. Over £1 billion of new UK aid will help end the pandemic as quickly as possible. Here in Pakistan we have pivoted our aid budget to help Pakistan fight Covid-19 and to help mitigate its health and economic impacts. G7 countries committed to a new “Pandemic Preparedness Partnership” to save countless lives from future diseases by reducing the time taken to develop new vaccines from 300 to 100 days; and the UK will set up a new Animal Vaccine Manufacturing Centre, building on British scientific excellence, that will help protect people from the risk of zoonotic diseases, here in Pakistan and globally. Second, on climate change, the G7 agreed that we have to act now to save our planet. As Sir David Attenborough told G7 leaders, our scientific collaboration on vaccines has showed just how much we can achieve together if the goal is clear and urgent. There is much the world can learn from Pakistan as we look to build back better by protecting the environment. Pakistan’s pioneering pledge to plant 10 billion trees and its promise to end new coal power investments are being noticed across the globe. Earlier this month Prime Minister Boris Johnson saluted Pakistan’s efforts to set a global leadership example on environmental issues during his speech for World Environment Day, hosted in Islamabad. This was closely followed by a phone call between Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Prime Minister Imran Khan, underlining the ongoing friendship between our two nations. At the G7, the UK built on its ambitious pledge to cut carbon emissions by 78% by 2035 compared to 1990 levels with further commitments on green finance, protecting our oceans, and on nature conservation. Leaders also committed to conserve or protect at least 30 per cent of land globally by the end of the decade, something Pakistan has already committed to. The UK will host the UN’s COP26 Climate Change Summit later this year, and will ensure a voice for the world’s most climate-vulnerable countries. Further ambitious commitments from Pakistan will send a powerful signal to the rest of the world. Third, the G7 agreed that we can only build back from the pandemic if we are better at ensuring opportunities for all in our societies. We know that a country can only reach its full potential when all of its population gets a good education. Pakistani girls and young women have shown time and again they have the ambition and talent to excel, when given the chance. The UK has played an important role in helping to educate girls in Pakistan. Through our education programmes, UK Aid has since 2011 helped over 5.5 million girls in primary school and 2.5 million girls in secondary school. Last year, nearly 60% of our Chevening scholars (the UK’s flagship postgraduate scholarship for leaders) were inspirational Pakistani women. We need to do more — it is not acceptable in today’s world that children and especially girls still miss out on a good education. We have to help our children catch up with lost learning due to the pandemic. At the G7, leaders agreed ambitious global targets to get more girls into school and learning, and pledged to increase their support to the Global Partnership for Education (GPE) in time for the Global Education Summit, being co-hosted by the UK and Kenya in July. The UK announced a commitment of £430 million. This is the largest pledge the UK has ever made to GPE; and in time, GPE aims to train 2.2 million more teachers, build 78,000 new classrooms and buy 512 million textbooks, transforming education opportunities for our world’s children. Global challenges do not respect borders. This was not just a small group of countries deciding what was best for the world. Instead, it was about bringing big ideas and resources to help tackle big challenges together, sharing knowledge and expertise. From the streets of Glasgow to the Karakoram mountains, our world is our responsibility. We have to act together — while we still have time."
"Boris Johnson","""We're restoring Britain's place as a scientific superpower""","21 June 2021","https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-article-in-the-daily-telegraph-21-june-2021","I cannot think of a time in the last 100 years when the entire population of this country has been so deeply and so obviously indebted to science – and to scientists. Had it not been for our scientists, we would not now be able to enjoy the most basic human freedoms: hugging relatives, meeting friends, playing football, going to the pub; or at least not without the risk of spreading a lethal disease. It is thanks to the vaccine roll-out that literally every person and every family in this country has an immediate future that is happier, more prosperous, more full of hope and opportunity, and if you think I am belabouring this point, it is because it needs belabouring. We have spent too long in a state of semi-detachment from science, as though it was something intimidating and remote from our lives. Too many people in our country lack training in science and technology, too many children think STEM subjects are not for them. Most glaringly of all, this country has failed for decades to invest enough in scientific research, and that strategic error has been compounded by the decisions of the UK private sector. It is a wretched fact that British firms are currently investing a fraction of the OECD average on research; and though the speed of the discovery of Oxford AstraZeneca was little short of miraculous, it was also something of a miracle that it took place here at all. Before Covid, the UK domestic vaccine industry had almost perished out of benign neglect. Had a couple of investment decisions gone the other way, this country might not have possessed the skills or practical capability to make vast batches of the vaccine that has been so indispensable to our success. So this is the moment to learn this stark lesson of the pandemic – our daily dependence on high-quality scientific research. It is also the moment to abandon any notion that government can be strategically indifferent, or treat research as a matter of abstract academic speculation. I am not suggesting that government should try to exercise scientific judgment, or impose some dogma on the scientific world – like the deranged genetic theories of Stalinist Russia. On the contrary, it is because we want to support high science, and to foster research that may or may not lead nowhere, that we are setting up the high-risk high reward ARIA agency, on the lines of DARPA in the US. We need to intensify the search for the unknown unknowns. And then there are the known unknowns, the nuts we know we need to crack, for the sake of our health and happiness. If the covid experience has taught us anything, it is that government does have a role in making demands, in explicitly framing the challenges we hope that science can meet. If we don’t, there are others who will. We made no particular effort to develop 5G, for instance, and we have paid a price. For the first time since the second world war, the largest western democracies were left behind in the race for a major new communications technology. It is a mistake that has proved expensive to rectify, and we don’t want to make another one like it. So we are investing unprecedented sums, increasing government spending to £22 billion for scientific research of all kinds; and we need to use those billions of state spending to leverage in the many more billions of the markets. One way to encourage those private sector investments is to give the market players the confidence that they are backing national priorities – so that public and private sector come together to deliver the breakthroughs, like the covid vaccine, that can transform our lives and economic prospects. To shape those priorities I will be chairing a new National Science and Technology Council, with Sir Patrick Vallance as my National Technology Adviser, so that together we can give the scientific world – in academia and across commercial laboratories – a sense of where we think we need to go. Some imperatives are already obvious. We need science urgently to accelerate the solutions that will help us to tackle climate change. We need progress on efficient power storage, hydrogen manufacture, net zero aviation, and other knotty problems raised in our ten point plan. We have a huge challenge to meet net zero by 2050, and not much time. But the vaccine programme has shown that when the pressure is on, humanity can produce feats of Manhattan Project-like speed, as the research of decades is compressed into months. It will be the job of the new National Science and Technology Council to signal the challenges – perhaps even to specify the breakthroughs required – and we hope that science, both public and commercial, will respond. We will be thinking about medical imperatives, such as tackling dementia or using new gene therapies to cure the hitherto incurable. We will be thinking about the new threats and opportunities in cyber, in space, and in the field of AI. We will of course be hoping that British science will play a leading role in fixing the problems of the world, providing everything from cheaper pharmaceuticals to drought-resistant crops. We will pursue these missions not just because each breakthrough could be a boon for humanity, but also because we want to see the expansion of scientifically-led start-ups and scale-ups, and a growth that goes beyond the golden triangle of Oxford-London-Cambridge and across the whole country. We want the UK to regain its status as a science superpower, and in so doing to level up. The UK has so many of the necessary ingredients: the academic base (four of the world’s top ten universities), a culture of innovation, the amazing data resource of the NHS, the capital markets. What we are offering now is record funding combined with the strongest possible political support and backing for science and a clear indication of where government sees greatest need. Of course we must generously fund pure science. We must allow for serendipity. You cannot plot or plan every breakthrough. But you can certainly set out to restore Britain’s place as a scientific superpower – while simultaneously driving economic prosperity and addressing the great challenges we face – and that is the plan of the government."
